Former governor of Bayelsa, Chief Timipre Sylva, and Minister of State for Agriculture and Rural Development, Senator Heineken Lokpobiri, have said the All Progressives Congress (APC) will rescue the state from the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). The duo addressed party members in Yenagoa, yesterday, and explained that the APC is a party formed to look after the needs of the masses. Sylva said: “Over N1 trillion has been collected and there is nothing to show for it. I came into Bayelsa state and the darkness I saw, I have not seen it in the darkest place around. What is happening in Bayelsa state? The stench from the garbage; I could not believe it. “Now, on top of over N1 trillion, the government has borrowed another N800 billion, yet, it cannot pay salaries, it is sacking people! What is happening in Bayelsa state? Now, on top of all this, this government has also received about $164 million from the Paris Club Refund, yet this government is owing another $216m. “Where are we going? Only the APC can change this situation. Only the APC can help Bayelsa state get out of the mess that we find ourselves.”
On his part, senator Lokpobiri reiterated there is no alternative to the APC, and averred that the party stands against corruption. “This is the opportunity to tell the good people of Bayelsa that there is no alternative to APC. APC stands against corruption. Bayelsa, today, has got over a trillion naira in six years. “The state government has taken loans of over N800 billion and all of us come from the smallest state inNigeria. I want you to reflect from this moment; what has been done in your community, what has been done in your local government that can justify N1.8 trillion?”

Emma Jemegah A community leader on Nembe, Bayelsa State, Chief Solomon Ockiya, has appealed to oil giant, Aiteo to fulfill its promise to the community by taking over the sponsorship of Nembe City FC. Chief Ochiya, who is the head of Ockiya-Omo group of war canoes houses in Nembe community in a statement after Nembe City FC failed to honour her weekend match in the Nigeria Nationwide League said it would be the joy of the indigenes of the community if Aiteo can bail out the team from its financial predicament, adding that as the largest oil exploration company in Nembe, Aiteo stands to gain from sponsoring the football team in terms of robust community relationship. “I was at the palace of His Highness when the management of Aiteo promised to take over the finances of Nembe City FC and the indigenes were excited at the development because Nembe City FC is the pride of the community. When Nembe City FC campaigned in the Premier League, it helped to project the image of the community and it was with excitement when the management of Aiteo told the monarch that as part of their Corporate Social Responsibility they would buy a bus for Nembe City as well as kit the team. “I am therefore using this opportunity to remind them of their promise, especially with reports that Nembe City failed to honour their last weekend’s match because their bus broke down on their way to match venue,” Chief Ockiya pleaded.

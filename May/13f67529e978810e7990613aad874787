Reuters/NAN Burkina Faso security forces killed three suspected terrorists and arrested one more on Tuesday morning in an operation on the outskirts of the capital Ouagadougou, state television reported. One gendarme was killed in the fighting in the Rayongo neighbourhood, while five people, including one civilian, were injured, the report said. NAN reports that on March 2, gunmen launched twin attacks in the capital of Burkina Faso, Ouagadougou, against the French embassy and army headquarters. Eight security personnel and eight attackers were killed in the fighting while 80 people including civilians, were wounded, officials say. This is the third major attack Ouagadougou has seen in the past two years. Islamist militants said they had carried out the other two. Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb said it was behind an attack on a restaurant and hotel in Ouagadougou in January 2016 that killed 30 people. France intervened to stop that group taking control of neighbouring Mali in 2013. But there are numerous other Islamist groups based in the region and militants have carried out attacks in several major West African cities in the past few years. Burkina Faso also saw a failed coup in 2015. The trial for dozens of the alleged perpetrators began earlier this week but was suspended after defence lawyers walked out in protest against the military court.

The Chairman, Plateau State Football Association, Hon. Sunday Samson Longbap, has reaffirmed his stance that Plateau State is still the home of great football talents in Nigeria. Longbap, who was speaking after NLO Division One side, Mighty Jets Feeders team narrowly overcame a samba playing non league side, Jazzy Stars football club at the quarter final stage of the Plateau State AITEO Cup, said: “I’m the happiest man on planet earth today considering the fact that football is still alive on the Plateau after been treated to the best of soccer artistry by young players and grassroots club sides. I watched some FA Cup matches played in some States by grassroots club sides this year, but I can boldly tell you that non can be compared to the standard of play we see from grassroots club sides on the Plateau, the mastery and prosecution of the game is second to non.”. Sunday Longbap also commended the Plateau State Governor, Simon Bako Lalong, for his unflinching support to sports development, especially football in the State; saying the peace we are currently enjoying on the Plateau now can be attributed to the fact that the youths have been kept busy with series of sporting activities financially and physically backed by the governor of the State. The final of theState AITEO Cup, which will see the State Governor in attendance, will have a repeat of last year’s finals, between defending champions, Plateau United fc and Mighty
Jets fc. It would be recalled that Mighty Jets fc beat Plateau Starlets 3-0 at the first semi finals, while Plateau United beat Mighty Jets Feeders team, that overcame a stubborn Jazzy Stars football club at the quarter finals 1-0. The final match will be on today at the Rwang Pam Township Stadium by 4pm.

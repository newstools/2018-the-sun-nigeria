Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja President Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, received the Chairman of the Progressives Governors Forum, Rochas Okorocha, as well as Zamfara State Governor, Abdullaziz Yari, in his hometown, Daura, Katsina State. Buhari left Abuja on Friday to Daura, to enable him take part in the ward congress of the ruling All Progressives Congress which took place nationwide on Saturday. The exercise, which was meant to elect new executives of the party at ward levels, witnessed protests and violence in some states in the country. Okorocha, who confirmed he came to brief President Buhari on the outcome of the exercise in his state, said, “we expect internal democracy and internal democracy is the way to go. Those kind of funny politics which were played must stop. A situation where people want to carry ballot boxes, steal results looks so primitive. I intimated Mr. President and we will make sure such things must stop.”
On what Buhari’s response was, the Imo governor said, “He spoke like the president and he will take the necessary steps to correct this in our party, the APC, not just in Imo State, but, across the whole nation, to make sure there is respect for internal democracy.” Yari, on his part, said the exercise went well in the north east region. He said: “You know in a democracy you cannot expect everything to work 100 percent. But, in our region, from the information available to to us, everything went well in Katsina, Kebbi, Sokoto, Zamfara and Kano, where people expected that there maybe a problem, the exercise was successful. But, anybody who has complain, there is a committee set up by the national executive of the party; they should take their complains there, so they will be attended to.”
Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, earlier posted photographs of the president and the Imo State Governor on his Facebook page.

Raphael Ede, Enugu Rainstorm, on Wednesday, wreaked havoc at Ezima Ogboku, Ugbonabor and Ugbo-Okpala communities in Awgu Local Government Area of Enugu State destroying residential buildings, hospitals and schools worth millions of Naira. The Daily Sun who visited the hill communities, on Wednesday, reported that the incident left the people now seeking shelter in neighbouring communities, while they continued to count their loses in millions. Apart from the residential houses, the Ogbaku Cottage Hospital and Ogbaku Community Health Centre as well as administrative and classroom blocks at the Ugbonabor Community Primary and Ugbo-Okpala Community Schools were also destroyed. Our correspondent who visited the community observed that some of them that are yet to find alternative shelter have been sleeping, cooking and eating outside the house. Conducting journalists round the devastated sites, the Ward Chairman of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Ogbaku, Mike Nwankwo said the disaster was first of its kind in the community. He, however, said the community was still grateful to God that no life was lost on the account of the disaster which he said took place on Sunday. “Presently, the affected people are now taking refuge in houses of their friends and relations, while some are still sleeping and doing other domestic activities in their compounds”, he stated. Okonkwo however, appealed to the National Emergency Management Agency, NEMA, to come to the aid of the victims. A community health worker at the Ogbaku Health Centre, Mrs Anioke Anastasia, called government quick intervention and re-roofs the damaged parts of the hospital as they stays under trees to attend to patients. At Ugbo-Okpala community school, a PTA teacher, Mrs. Agu Jene told newsmen that the children the storms affected their class are now studying under the Manago tree to receive their studys.

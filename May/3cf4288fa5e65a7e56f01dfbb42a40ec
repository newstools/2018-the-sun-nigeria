The International Federation of Women Lawyers (FIDA), Kano Branch, has called on government to make a law that would protect women and children of divorced parents. Kano State Chairperson of FIDA, Hajia Hussaina Adamu, made the call on Monday during the associationâ€™s courtesy visit to the state Commissioner of Justice, Mr Ibrahim Mukhtar. Adamu said that the law became necessary in order to reduce persistent sufferings faced by children of divorcees after separation. She said FIDA would partner with the state Ministry of Justice and other human rights groups to stop the maltreatment of divorced women and their children. In his remark, the commissioner expressed dismay at the pitiable experience of some women and their children after divorce. Mukhtar advised FIDA to sensitise the public on activities of the association to enable other female lawyers join them in supporting vulnerable women.

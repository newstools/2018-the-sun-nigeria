Samuel Bello, Abuja A former National Legal Adviser of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Bashir Maidugu, says former President Olusegun Obasanjo’s strident criticisms of President Muhammadu Buhari are nothing but the usual trademarks of the former president who he says lacks consistency in the appreciation of national issues. The APC stalwart made the statement during an interview with newsmen in Abuja. Maidugu urged Nigerians to be wary of the antics of the former president who he accused of attacking leaders he had assisted to power when they no longer dance to his tune or allow themselves to be manipulated by him, citing his “betrayal” of Late President Umaru Musa Yar’adua and former President Goodluck Jonathan. On the alleged $16 billion expended during the eight years of the Obasanjo presidency, he called for the setting of a probe panel, saying that it is regrettable that Nigeria remains in darkness despite the colossal amount so far spent on the power sector. Maidugu, who is now a stalwart of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), recommended that those found wanting by the probe panel should be prosecuted in the spirit of the current administration’s anti-corruption campaign. On the restructuring of the country, Maidugu believes the call for states to set up their own police outfits to address current security challenges across the country will further compound the problems of state governments that can hardly pay salaries of their workers, adding that anarchy could become the order of the day when young policemen, frustrated by non-payment of salaries, refuse to provide security or turn round to fight back with state-owned arms in their possession.

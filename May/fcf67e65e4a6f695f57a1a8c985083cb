In his remarks, Chairman, Commissioners of Finance Forum, Mahmoud Yunusa, said though the states were happy that the shared revenue was higher than the previous month, they were anxious to see the monthly allocation hit the N1 trillion target. He also said states were pushing for a review of the revenue sharing formula to make it equitable and justifiable. “We’ve passed the N600 billion mark but our target is N1 trillion is yet to be attained, and we’re working hard on boosting non oil revenue. “Revenue sharing formula is being looked in to make it justifiable and equitable. States and local governments should have more revenues to enable the grassroots feel the impact of government.
We know some other areas need a boost, but that doesn’t mean we should not push for a review of revenue sharing formula”, Yunusa stated.

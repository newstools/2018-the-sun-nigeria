As part of efforts geared towards ensuring discipline in the Super Eagles during the team’s campaign in Russia, team handler Gernot Rohr has decreed that Russian girls and women of easy virtues would not have access to the team’s camp. The exception to the rule however is with regards to team Captain Mikel Obi whose partner is a Russian. Rohr read the riot act at a press conference on Friday in where he stated that he will allow family members to visit the Super Eagles at their base camp in Yessentuki during the 2018 World Cup but the players apart from Obi Mikel are forbidden from meeting with Russian girls and woman of easy virtue. Mikel’s Russian female partner, Olga Diyachenko, and their kids will not be prevented from seeing the Nigeria captain after matches during the tournament in her homeland.
‘’I will do like other teams, but only families of the players will be allowed to see their husbands,’’ Rohr told reporters. ‘’Their children will be allowed also, on Sunday after our first match on Saturday. Families of the players are free to see their husbands, not Russians girls or ‘professional girls’. ‘’Our disciplinary measures have to be stronger while in the camp. Players are not allowed to see other girls, except their family members after the game. ‘’They can even eat with us if they so like. Each player has his room, no problem for family members, they are free to come.’’

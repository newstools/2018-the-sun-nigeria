Laide Raheem, Abeokuta Suspected hoodlums yesterday disrupted the local government congress of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Yewa South local government area of Ogun State. The exercise which was to elect executive committee members to pilot the affairs of the party in the local government, was brought to an abrupt end when the hoodlums led by one Sunday Ogungbire, a.k.a Oba, a councilor in the local government, started to throw projecti into the Gateway Multi-Purpose Hall, Empire Field, Ilaro, venue of the congress. The exercise was attended by APC governorship aspirant, Hon. Abiodun Akinlade, Commissioner for Forestry, Kola Lawal, a member of Ogun State Judiciary Commission, Biyi Otegbeye and Senator Iyabo Anisulowo. Sunday Sun gathered that the exercise was ongoing, when ward exco members who were elected at the partyâ€™s ward congress last Saturday discovered that their names were missing on the delegates list. It was further learnt that names of the delegates had been switched and replaced with names of party members suspected to be loyal to an APC chieftain in the local government. The delegates, it was gathered, in an attempt to protest the irregularity, were dispersed with missiles thrown into the venue by the hoodlums, the development which ended the exercise abruptly.

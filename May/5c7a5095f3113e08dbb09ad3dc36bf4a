He said union members have agreed that its legal team approach the Court of Appeal on the matter.
Josiah insisted that members have vowed not to succumb to the blackmail or intimidation by either the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) or the federal government, including the threat of proscription. “Our request is a genuine one and government is aware of it. “But, perhaps, they have deliberately disregarded it. However, we will continue to press until our demands are met,” he said. Josiah encouraged the members to endure the discomfort and persevere “until success is achieved.”

Gyang Bere, Jos There was panic in Jos Monday when a 15-year-old son of a community leader in Farin-Gada, Joseph Zarma, was allegedly killed by suspected ritualists in Jos North Local Government Area of Plateau State. Daily Sun gathered that the boy was killed and the corpse dumped on a major street of Farin-Gada, which attracted protests by youths of the community. It was learned that the minor left home at about 7 p.m. on Sunday night to go and visit her grandmother and was caught up with the ritualists who killed him and gouged out his eyes, tongue and private parts. The gory murder caused tensions in the community leading to a mass protest that spread to neighbouring communities in Jos, the state capital. As a result of brewing tensions and fears of having the protest turn violent, residents of the area refused to open their shops. An eyewitness, who gave his name as Chidi, told journalists that, “we woke up this morning and found the dead body of the child with his eyes and private parts removed and that was why people were protesting.” Police Public Relation Officer (PPRO) of Plateau State Police Command, ASP Mathias Tyopev Terna, confirmed the incident, recalling that: “In the early hours of Monday, we got a report that a corpse was lying behind tomato market.” “We quickly came in and evacuated the corpse and on observation we realized that tension was brewing in the area. Our men were quickly detailed to curtail the situation and the situation is perfectly under control,” the police spokesman said. He advised the Plateau citizens to go about with their normal activities, to be vigilant and report any suspicious activities to the police.

Sola Ojo, Kaduna A northern group known as Northern Youths Council of Nigeria (NYCN) has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to either fulfill his campaign promises or forget about a second term. The NYCN said a lot of Nigerians have lost confidence in democracy, as a result of daily assaults, including the wrong use of government apparatuses to harass perceived enemies, threats of impeachment, kidnapping, banditry. NYCN President, Isah Abubakar, in a statement made available to newsmen, in Kaduna, yesterday, added that security of lives and property of citizens are mirage now. “We call on the Federal Government, led by president Muhammadu Buhari, as a matter of integrity, to deliver many promises he made to Nigerians before the the expiration of his first term in office to qualify him for a second term. “If not, northern youths would have no option but scout for a more promising, young person to take over the leadership of the country come 2019. “People now sleep in fear. Killings across Nigeria have become the norm, hunger and bad health facilities. These and many more are threats to democracy in Nigeria and anywhere in the world.”
Abubakar further added that “amongst these challenges, however, there is a great fear for our democracy come 2019; judging from the internal crisis that is rocking the ruling party’s congresses across the nation. “NYCN is developing among youth, women and children through requisite leadership qualities that will overturn the status quo in order to build Nigeria of our dream if the current leadership fail to do that. The Northern Youths Council is poised to supporting and empowering the right leadership framework and application of our rules of engagements, with women and youths as drivers, especially in leadership at all levels of government. “We are determined to join hands with well-meaning Nigerians to, from 2019, rid Nigeria of corrupt elements in government.”

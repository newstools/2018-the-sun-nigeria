Enyimba International Football Club of Nigeria on Saturday, departed for Brazzaville for Wednesday’s Group C clash against Congolese side CARA. The two-time African champions will look to follow up an impressive opening victory against Djoliba with another win, and so consolidate top spot in the group. Chairman, Chief Felix Anyansi Agwu revealed that the somewhat early departure is due to the timing of the game, which is scheduled to kick off at 2pm on May 16. “Going and spending one extra day will actually be more expensive for us,” he acknowledged.”

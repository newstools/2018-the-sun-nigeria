Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, has said but for the immunity Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State enjoys, he would have been invited over his allegation that the Federal Government was planning to assassinate him. Mohammed said this while responding to a question from State House Correspondents demanding to know Federal Government’s reaction to the allegation. Governor Wike made the allegation, last Sunday, during a church thanksgiving in Port Hrcourt, the state capital, as well as on Channels TV, on Monday. In the words of Mohammed, “As for the question about the allegation by the governor of Rivers that he has information that he will be assassinated by the Federal Government in a crowd. “I think one of the beauties of being a governor is that you enjoy immunity from prosecution and arrest. Because, I remember a couple of years ago when I made similar allegations I was invited to Force Headquarters.” On when the Minister of Mines and Steel and the All Progressive Congress (APC), the gubernatorial flag-bearer in Ekiti State elections, in July, will resign his appointment as cabinet minister, the Information minister said, “I think I read it just like you that he will resign this week. If he did say so, today is just Wednesday. “I think we still have the rest of the week to see if he will resign. But I think really he is the best person that can speak on it.” Fayemi had told journalists before the commencement of FEC meeting that he still had one week as minister. He had said on when he is resigning from the cabinet, “There is still a lot of work to do. The constitution again is very clear, what the constitution says in Section 182 is that I must leave the cabinet at least 30 days before the general election. “Well, I am the candidate of our party and I am also the minister of the Federal Republic at least for the next one week. So, for the next one week, I am the minister of mines and steel.”

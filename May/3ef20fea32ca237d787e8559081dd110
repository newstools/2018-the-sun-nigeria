Paul Osuyi, Asaba Following the conduct of the congress to elect executive members of the All Progressive Congress (APC), a three-member appeal panel, on Wednesday morning, arrived Asaba, the state capital to receive complaints from any aggrieved actor. The panel chaired by former majority leader of Edo State House of Assembly, Mr. Matthew Iduoriyekemwen said they were authorised by national secretariat of the party to hear appeals that may emanate from the congress conducted on Monday only. Speaking with journalists, chairman of the panel, Iduoriyekemwen however described the congress as rancour free and devoid of acrimony, confirming that they were yet to receive any complain from any member of the party in the state. According to him, those who feel disenfranchised, shortchanged or for obvious reasons denied participation according to the party’s constitution  in any way can seek redress through the committee. “We are here basically in the state to receive appeals but as at today, we are yet to receive any. When we stay within the stipulated time and we don’t receive any, we report back to the national secretariat of our great party,” he said. He maintained that should there be any report from any aggrieved member, “as a committee, we will look at it, call for evidence, make findings, take decisions and equally report back to the national secretariat who has the final decision on the outcome of the conduct of the congress at all levels.” The former lawmaker, however added that as at press time, the state secretariat of the party was under luck and key, adding that the secretary was not on seat. Responding to questions, he disclosed that the key actors in the party have his contact, and that “before the congress they all spoke to me, we were not secretly selected, they all know we are coming here.”

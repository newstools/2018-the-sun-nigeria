Rose Ejembi, Makurdi A market Chief in Katsina-Ala Local Government Area of Benue State identified as Godwin Tor Geri Gbajur has been reportedly shot dead by some gunmen in the early hours of Saturday. Sunday Sun gathered that the gunmen stormed the GRA residence of the chief about 6:30am to carry out the dastardly act. According to a close source, the assailants had demanded to see Gbajur, who unsuspecting of their evil intention, came out of his room to introduce himself to them and fell easy prey. “They shot him at close range. And as soon as they were convinced that he had died, they (gunmen) jumped on the Bajaj motorcycle they came with and sped off shooting sporadically,” the source said. The body of the deceased was said to have been taken to the General Hospital, Katsina-Ala, morgue. Confirming the report, State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), ASP Moses Yamu, said the assassins stormed the home of the victim about 6:48am and on ascertaining that he was Godwin, they shot him dead at a close range. His words: “The Benue State Police Command wishes to report that at about 0648hrs of today, one Godwin Gbajur (Katsina-Ala Township Leader, aka, Tor Gari) was assassinated in his GRA residence at the outskirts of Katsina-Ala LGA by two armed bandits. “Eye witness account reveals that the assassins rode on two Bajaj motorcycles to the house of the victim and inquired from him if he was Godwin, which he answered in affirmative before he was eventually shot dead. Eight empty shells of AK-47 ammunition were recovered at the scene.
“Preliminary investigation reveals that the assassins are gang members of Terwase Akwaza aka “Ghana”, the notorious wanted criminal in the State.” Yamu said efforts were ongoing to ensure that the bandits are arrested and brought to justice.

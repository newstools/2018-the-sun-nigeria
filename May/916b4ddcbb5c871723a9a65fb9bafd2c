Goal Arsenal have confirmed the appointment of Unai Emery as the club’s new manager. The Spaniard – who left Paris Saint-Germain at the end of the season despite winning a domestic treble – has signed a two-year deal at the Emirates Stadium. He becomes just the Gunners’ second manager since 1996 after Arsene Wenger’s 22-year reign was brought to an end in the wake of Arsenal’s sixth-placed finish in the Premier League. “Unai has an outstanding track record of success throughout his career, has developed some of the best young talent in Europe and plays an  exciting, progressive style of football that fits Arsenal perfectly,” said Arsenal chief executive Ivan Gazidis.

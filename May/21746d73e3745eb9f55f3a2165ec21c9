Tony John, Port Harcourt The N1 billion defamation suit filed by the Amanyanabo of Okochiri Kingdom,  King Ateke Tom, against eight chieftains of the All Progressives Congress (APC), in Rivers State, on Wednesday, suffered another setback due to the absence of the trial judge in court. The monarch had slammed the suit against the Chairman of APC in the state, Chief Davies Ikanya,   deputy governorship candidate of the APC in the 2015 election, Asita O.  Asita, Dumo Lulu-Briggs, Sampson Ngerigbar and others,  for describing him as a criminal and cultist during their pro-Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) rally in Port Harcourt. The defendants in suit number PHC/345/2018 at the State High Court, were alleged to be evading service, but the trial judge, Justice Constance Green, had ordered  Ateke’s counsel, Mr. Granville Abibo, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), and court bailiffs for a substituted service on the APC stalwarts. When the court resumed yesterday,  for pre-trial hearing, the clerk informed that sitting had been adjourned till  June 20, following the absence of the judge. Meanwhile, a group of people from Okrika drawn from chiefs, elders and youths stormed the court premises in protest condemning the defamation of their king by the defendants. The leader of the protesters, Chief  Dere Oforome, said they were in court to register their displeasure over “sin against the throne in Okrika Kingdom”. Also, Nollywood actors and actresses led by Chief Pete Edochie, urged the court to give the matter an accelerated hearing, so as to serve as deterrent to people,  who disrespect the traditional institution.

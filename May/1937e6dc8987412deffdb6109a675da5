Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja The Presidency has denied media reports alleging that the it substituted or smuggled in some names of members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) into the Convention Planning sub-Committees. The members of the defunct new Peoples Democratic Party (nPDP) bloc had alleged that their names were removed from the convention planning committee. At the inauguration of the convention sub-committees, on Wednesday, in Abuja, it was gathered that some members dropped from the committee had launched a protest, accusing the Presidency of doctoring the list. Special Adviser to the President (Media & Publicity), Femi Adesina, in a statement, described the allegation as untrue, insisting President Muhammadu Buhari’s position remains that he would not interfere in party affairs or matters before the law courts. The statement read: “We are constrained to deny media reports alleging that the Presidency substituted or smuggled in some names of members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Convention Planning Sub-Committees. “Nothing in the allegation can be further from the truth in every material particular. For the umpteenth time, we wish to reiterate President Muhammadu Buhari’s position that he will not interfere in party affairs or matters before the law courts. “It ought to have been obvious by now to discerning Nigerians that it is not in the nature of this President to go against the provisions of the country’s constitution let alone his party’s constitutional provisions. “It is, therefore, disingenuous to attribute every perceived infraction in activities of party or government appointees to the President’s desk.”

Obele who made this known in Lagos, said that the terminal’s capacity utilisation grew from 3,000 Twenty Equivalent Units, (TEUs) in 2016 to 5,000 TEUs in 2017. He  also said they are projecting a further growth in capacity utilization of 71.4 per cent that is 7,000 TEUs this year from over and above the 5,000 TEUs recorded last year.

He also said all the security apparatus required at a conventional port are on ground at the facility.

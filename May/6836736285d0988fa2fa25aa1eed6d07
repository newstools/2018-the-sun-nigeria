Desmond Mgboh, Kano Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje of Kano State, has waded into the raging crisis in the Kano State House of Assembly, averting a potential move by some lawmakers to remove the Speaker of the House, Hon. Yusuf Abdullahi Atta. Government House told Daily Sun that the governor, upon arrival from Jigawa State, where he had traveled to receive President Muhammadu Buhari who was on a two day visit, had summoned the warring parties for a mid night meeting. A statement signed by the Kano State Commissioner for Information, Malam Muhammed Garba, Wednesday morning said that the governor had succeeded in reconciling the parties of the State House of Assembly . The statement further read that, “Following the reconciliation which brought the crisis to an end, the Assembly will open on Thursday to further consolidate on the resolutions of the meeting. “ The reconciliation was held late last night at the Government House between the representatives of the two feuding factions and Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje to resolve the crisis in the interest of the peace and democratic development of the state” said the statement. Meanwhile, it is not clear in the state whether the sacking of the two principal officers by the 24 members of the House of Assembly would subsist or it would be reversed in the spirit of the reconciliation.

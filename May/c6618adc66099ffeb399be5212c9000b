Emma Njoku Rights advocate, Eve Adams, has urged Nigerians to ensure that efforts of the country’s democratic heroes do no go in vain. In a statement to mark this year’s Democracy Day celebration, Adams recalled that Nigeria’s return to democratic governance was not a child’s play and, as such, should not be toyed with. She said: “We must resolve to make democracy work in Nigeria, because this Fourth Republic was not easy to come by, therefore, it must not be taken for granted. For us to get to this point, it took many years of sacrificial struggle. Lives were lost and property destroyed in the various protests which led to the decision of the military to return to barracks. The wounds in many homes are yet to heal, so, we must jealously guard, promote and practice democracy by the rules. “My heart bleeds when I hear politicians make comments which are capable of setting this country on fire. Many a times, I wonder if such people knew what those who were in the trenches went through, during those years of struggle.” She acknowledged the role of the opposition in the sustainability and growth of the democracy, but, advised that, “their criticism must be constructive and devoid of sentiments capable of causing disaffection among Nigerians.” An All Progressives Congress aspirant for Shiroro, Rafi, Munya Federal Constituency in Niger State, urged more women participation in active politics rather than sit on the fence. “Although we have made quite a remarkable progress, especially, under President Muhammadu Buhari’s leadership, the task ahead are enormous and requires all hands to be on deck,” she said.

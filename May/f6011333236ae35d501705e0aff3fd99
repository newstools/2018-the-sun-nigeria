The Youth and Sports Minister, Solomon Dalung, said he is convinced the Super Eagles can exceed previous standards set at the World Cup The Minister who spoke at the send forth of the Eagles to Russia 2018 hosted by President Buhari noted that the team had qualified for the World Cup six times and had advanced to the round of 16, said the current team will exceed the record of previous outings. He said, “As the present set of Super Eagles make sure that Nigeria’s flag is hoisted once more at the tournament, they will do so conscious of the glorious outing of their predecessors while determined to make history themselves. “This Super Eagles have already started on a very positive note by qualifying in style for Russia 2018. You will recall that when the Super Eagles were drawn in the so-called group of death for the African qualifiers, not many gave them a chance of qualification from the group that had African football giants like Cameroon, Algeria and Zambia. However, the Super Eagles shocked all Doubting Thomases by not only qualifying for the World Cup 2018 but also doing so remarkably with a match to spare. Furthermore, they became the first team in Africa to qualify for the tournament. “All these were made possible because of your support and frequent intervention Your Excellency, to ensure welfare of the team through the timely release of funds for the prosecution of the qualifier. This did not come as a surprise because since 1985 when the Nigerian Golden Eaglets won the FIFA World Cup under your administration then, your support for all the national team has not been in doubt. “You sir are unquestionably the number one fan of the Super Eagles and for that we are grateful.

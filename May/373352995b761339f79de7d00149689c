Labalaba is the Yoruba word for butterfly is a follow-up to Vibes, which was released last month. It will be recalled that the singer who recently bagged a BET Awards nominated for Best International Act has been enjoying a good spell of hits and recognition of late. Labalaba is a feel good love song and it was mixed and mastered by STG. Mavin Records first lady, Tiwa Savage has been firing all cylinders in recent times and it doesn’t look like shes about to take a chill pill just yet. She resurfaces on Jaguda.com with her third single of the year titled “Labalaba.” Labalaba comes barely over a week after she shared a Spellz produced banger titled “Tiwa’s Vibe” which is still rocking the airwaves. The song was mixed and mastered by STG. Seems being “besties” with Starboy, Wizkid has it perks.

Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate, Professor Olushola Eleka, has said he is prepared to win the July 14 governorship poll for the party. He said this while receiving his Certificate of Return at the party’s National Secretariat in Abuja, yesterday. He assured the PDP national leadership that with his nomination as candidate, the party is poised to win the poll, noting that none of the other political parties stands a chance in the contest.
Kolapo expressed appreciation to Governor Ayodele Fayose for standing by him during the process leading to the PDP nomination. “I count myself privileged as the first governorship candidate of our party to be issued a certificate of return. Today is historical and it will go down in history; what this means is that we have won the election. “Heaven has sanctioned it that PDP will continue in government in Ekiti State after the expiration of the tenure of my amiable leader, Governor Fayose. I want to assure our national leaders that Ekiti is for PDP, all the other parties are just shouting. Let them bring money, let them bring violence, Ekiti people will resist them. “We are no more interested in accommodating unnecessary interlopers. People want to take us through another round of economic slavery. We are no more ready for that. I am ready and prepared to take up this challenge as the incoming governor of Ekiti State on the platform of the PDP,” he said.

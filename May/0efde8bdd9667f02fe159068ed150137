Ekiti State governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Dr. Kayode Fayemi, has picked Alhaja Habibat Adubiaro as his running mate in the July 14 governorhsip election in the state. It was gathered that Adubiaro, who is the president of the Federation of Muslim Women Associations of Nigeria (FOMWAN),has served as a commissioner for Women Affairs. The Ado-Ekiti born woman is also a senior lecturer at the Federal University, Oye-Ekiti. The choice of Adubiaro as running mate to the APC’s governorship candidate came few weeks after the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ekitri picked the immediate past Chairman of Ado Local Government, Kazeem Deji Ogunsakin, as the running mate to its governorship candidate, Prof. Kolapo Olusola. Ogunsakin, 39, was said to have been picked after the PDP’s extensive consultation with various stakeholders, including the youths and the Muslim community in the state. From the development, it appears both the APC and the PDP are sheming for votes from Ado Ekiti, considerd to be the most populated council with the largest votes in the state.

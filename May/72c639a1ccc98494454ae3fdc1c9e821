Brown Chimezie Igbo leader and Eze Ndigbo Lagos State, Nwabueze Ohazuilike, has described the killings in the country as the greatest threat to Nigeria’s economy. He also decried the spate of killings in the country and declared that the country’s future is doomed if the killings are not stopped. Ohazulike, who made the statement recently in Lagos, while commenting on the state of the nation, said God abhors killing in all its ramifications and added that killings instil fear and spread panic among peace-loving people in the country. While calling on security agencies to do everything possible to stop the killings, he lamented the inability of farmers to go to their farms due to fear of being attacked. He said there are dare consequences awaiting the country if nothing is done as the country’s future lies in farming.
“When the food baskets are attacked and people abandon their farmlands and flee, it portend disaster for the agricultural sector, and unless drastic action is taken to restore confidence and orderliness, it can result in famine and hunger in the country,” he said. While commending Governor Willie Obiano of his home state, Anambra, for agriculture revolution which is gradually making the state food sufficient, Ohazulike, who has gone back to large-scale farming, praised the governor for creating an enabling environment for farming activities to thrive in the state.

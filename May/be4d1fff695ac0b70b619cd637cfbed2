NYTimes President Trump announced on Thursday that his meeting with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, will be held on June 12 in Singapore. Mr Trump made his announcement in a Twitter post on Thursday morning, just hours after he met the three recently-freed American hostages at Joint Base Andrews, where they arrived in the middle of the night after their release by North Korea.  The summit will be the first face-to-face between a sitting American president and the North Korean leader.

•Considering Ajiboye over Akpeyi If feelers from officials of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) are anything to go by, Super Eagles manager, Gernot Rohr might have made up his mind on four of the six players to be dropped from the 30-man list to the Russia 2018 World Cup. After the friendly match with DR Congo on Monday, the German openly criticised his full backs and said he need to work on them before the football party in Russia. But top officials of the football federation have squealed that four players have already been penciled down for the axe.
NPFL leading scorer, Junior Lokosa had a decent debut against DR Congo, but he would be one of the players to be dropped, according to the informants. Other players likely to get the chop are Ola Aina, Uche Agbo, Stephen Eze and Chidozie Awaziem.
In the same vein, South Africa-based goalkeeper, Daniel Akpeyi could be a shock omission from the World Cup, as officials informed that coach Rohr was considering the CHAN Eagles safe hands ahead of him. The Plateau United goalkeeper had shone in training, raising indications he might be considered ahead of Akpeyi, who at a time was the country’s No.2.
The former Warri Wolves goalkeeper was also a cover for Emmanuel Daniel at the 2016 Rio Olympics where Nigeria won bronze. Rohr is expected to announce the players who will not fly out with the squad to England later today. Moses Simon had already been ruled out of the World Cup and Awaziem’s case was a bit complex because his ankle injury was thought to be nothing serious but he is yet to return to training and with the team set to depart for England tomorrow, his case could also be same as Simon, which meant their possible inclusion in the squad will depend on a scan in England.

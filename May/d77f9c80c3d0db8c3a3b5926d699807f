The Mutual Union of Tiv in the United Kingdom (MUTUK) has strongly condemned what it described as the grotesque killings of Benue people by invading Fulani herdsmen.
The group especially condemned the recent attack on St. Ignatius Catholic Church, Ukpor-Mbalom in Gwer East Local Government Area of Benue State in which 19 Tiv people including two catholic priests were gruesomely murdered.
In a statement signed by MUTUK President, Kuram Gwakyaa, the group regretted the frustration and nightmare being faced by the Benue people over the incessant herdsmen attacks which had left hundreds dead and hundreds of thousands homeless.
The statement which was made available to Sunday Sun by MUTUk’s Publicity Secretary, Salome Biam maintained that the Tivs in the UK are working assiduously to identify further measures that can be taken to curb the incessant killings in the state.
“We are mindful that the horrific killings in 2018 are the culmination of years of unchecked violence. This is a hugely complicated issue which has been made even worse through religious hatred.
“It is beyond our powers as a non governmental body to deliver a solution to this dire situation, but we are committed to doing anything within our powers to ensure that a swift resolution is made by the relevant bodies.
“President Buhari’s failure to act thus far is reprehensible and it is high time the government stepped in to resolve the wretched situation in Benue State,” the statement concluded.

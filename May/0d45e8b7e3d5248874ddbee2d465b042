His words: “For me, the seminar is very timely and a bold attempt at galvanizing public support and awareness for Super Eagles. More importantly, the effort is a brainchild of one of Nigeria’s most widely read newspaper. I have had the privilege of attending five World Cups and I would be in Port Harcourt to bring my knowledge and experience to bear at the conference.” Bako, a former director general of Nigeria Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) covered the 1973 All Africa Games for NBC, Kaduna.

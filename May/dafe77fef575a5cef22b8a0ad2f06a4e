Paul Erewuba Former Green Eagles’ captain, Segun Odegbami has commended The Sun Publishing Company for organising a seminar to galvanise support for the Super Eagles ahead of Russia 2018 FIFA World Cup, saying it is a welcome development.
The seminar, billed for Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital, on May 22 is titled: “That Super Eagles may excel in Russia and beyond”. In a chat with SportingSun yesterday, Chief Odegbami said anything that could be done now to attract support for the Eagles to excel at the World Cup in Russia is laudable and in the right direction. “It is a good idea and I welcome it whole heartedly. The Super Eagles need to be encouraged so as to perform very well at Russia 2018. We have the players that can hold their own when the chips are done, but they still need our support and encouragement. “And I think The Sun coming up with this seminar is an added advantage, and I call on Nigerians to see it as a project that all of us must key into.’

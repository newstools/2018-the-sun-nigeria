Fred Ezeh, Abuja The leadership of the Joint Health Sector Unions (JOHESU) has summoned an emergency consultation meeting of all state and zonal leaders to deliberate on the next line of action regarding the ongoing nationwide strike. The emergency meeting is in response to an order of interim injunction by the National Industrial Court (NIC) that compelled JOHESU members to immediately resume duties. An NGO, Kingdom Human Rights Foundation International, took JOHESU to NIC and obtained an interim injunction in their favour. JOHESU President Biobebelemoye Josiah confirmed to newsmen in Abuja, at the weekend, that they received the court communication at about 5:39 p.m. on Friday, informing the decision to call for the stakeholders meeting to deliberate on the matter. He said that the decision to either end the strike in obedience to the court or otherwise will be taken at the meeting. The JOHESU President who, speaking through President of the Assembly of Healthcare Professional Associations (AHPA), Dr Godswill Okara, advised government to honour the agreement with the Union for peace and normalcy to return to hospitals. JOHESU has repeatedly accused the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) of misinforming Nigerians that its members locked up theatres, consulting rooms and wards. “That was untrue,” he said. “Our members have conducted themselves with the highest degree of restraint and discipline in the face of provocation and double-dealing by the Federal Ministry of Health,” he added. The Union commended Senate leadership for the recent intervention aimed at full and amicable resolution of the crisis. “We also commend Nigerians of good conscience who have lent their voices to our struggle for justice, fairness and equity in the health sector,” he said.

Tony John, Port Harcourt Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State has stated that the Mile One Market in Port Harcourt would be completed by December. Speaking after project inspection, on Tuesday , Governor Wike said that the construction of the market was in fulfilment of his pledge to the people. He said: “This is one of our signature projects. We are putting in place a befitting market for traders in the area.

Xinhua/NAN The Ugandan military has vowed to tighten border patrol after reports that Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) rebels killed 10 civilians in neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Richard Karemire, spokesperson of Uganda People’s Defence Forces (UPDF), said on Tuesday that the army is on alert in case ADF rebels try to attack Ugandans. “On the evening of May 19, ADF attacked a place called Mankoko, between Mbau trading centre and Mavivi Airport on Beni Oicha road, about 15 km north of Beni Town, killing 10 civilians and injuring two,” Karemire said. The killed were nine men and one woman, while two women were injured. “The UPDF will continue to strengthen border patrols along the border with the DRC to protect Ugandans and their property,” Karemire said. “Security forces will also step up coordination and intelligence exchange with DRC counterparts to eliminate ADF from the region,” he added. ADF rebels launched their first attacks in Uganda in 1996. The UPDF managed to flush them out of the country a few years later and drove them into DRC. Though some rebels have responded to government amnesty and surrendered to authorities in DRC and Uganda, some pockets remain in the forests and they continue attacking villages in the DRC. About 100 ADF fighters were killed in combined efforts by the UPDF and the DRC army in December.

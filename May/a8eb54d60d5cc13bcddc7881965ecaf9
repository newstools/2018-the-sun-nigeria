Tony Osauzo and Ighomuaye Lucky, Benin It was a day of glory for athletes from Kenya, as they emerged winners in the male category while an Ethiopian, Yani Dera Dida, won in the female category in the Okpekpe 10km International Race which held Saturday in Edo State. Kibet Alex ran 29.46 seconds to emerge winner in the male category. Simon Chepat took second in 30.29 seconds, while Ronoh Timothy took third, finishing 30.39 seconds. Other female athletes from Kenya who took second and third positions, respectively, were Tuei Sandra Chebey who ran 33.33, and Kipyokei Diana. Speaking to newsmen, Kibet said the weather affected the time he intended to finish on. “I want to thank God for winning this race. This is my first time to be here. The course was not easy, especially the finishing point. The starting point was okay but the finishing point was hilly. “The organisation need to put in more for the race to get the gold label. The rain makes the time to go worse.” Foreign athletes, including their Nigeria counterparts, had earlier began their race 20 minutes before the rain began. Among dignitaries who participated in the VIP race were former Governor Adams Oshiomhole, Governor Godwin Obaseki, Minister of Sports, Solomon Dalung, Edo Deputy Governor, Hon Philip Shaibu, Edo First Lady, Mrs. Betsy Obaseki, former Commissioner for Environment, Mr. Clem Agba amongst others. Governor Obaseki and Oshiomhole completed the Okpekpe race despite the rain. Vice Chancellor of the Ambrose Alli University Prof. Igantious Onimawo led students and top management staff of the institution to run against cultism. Prof. Onimawo stressed that cultism has become a menace in society that needed to be eradicated.

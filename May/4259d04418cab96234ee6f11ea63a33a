Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja The Presidency has described as “short on credibility” the recent Amnesty International report alleging human rights violation by Nigerian security agencies. Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity Garba Shehu said in a statement that the report “is inherently battling with credibility, falling vehemently short of evidential narration. “It is short on credibility because it does not contain factual leads that could have laid the foundation for investigative actions.” According to the statement, “Findings are attributed to people but proper description of such people constituting the source of information is not provided. “Engagement was claimed to have been made with Nigerian authorities but which authority is it, is not provided with clarity. This then is just a wild goose chase report, in essence.” The Presidency went on to state: “In some breath, the report seemed like the one in 2015, and the one in 2016, and the one after that year, the same things being recycled again and again.

We commit to ensure that all documented cases of human rights abuses are investigated, and those responsible for violation held responsible.’”

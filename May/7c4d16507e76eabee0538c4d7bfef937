India’s Supreme Court on Friday refused to order an independent probe into the death of Bollywood Superstar Sridevi Kapoor in Dubai earlier this year. The actress died at a hotel in Dubai in February this year, aged 54. Though initial reports claimed she had died of a heart attack, however, Dubai police later clarified that her death was “due to accidental drowning after loss of consciousness.’’ A three-judge bench of the apex court on Friday morning turned down a plea by a private person for an independent investigation into the veteran actress’ death, saying it found no reasons to doubt the Dubai police’s probe. Sridevi was recently given the national award for the best actress posthumously for her role in her last revenge film Mom. The actress made her debut as child artiste with the 1967 Tamil film Kandan Karunai at the age of four. In her 50-year career, she starred in a number of southern Indian movies and several Bollywood blockbusters. Sridevi was ranked among the highest-paid actors in the 1980s and 1990s and is considered as the Indian cinema’s first female superstar.

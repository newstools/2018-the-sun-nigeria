NAN World’s most popular entertainment complex Disney World located in Florida, USA, has canceled a popular Christian music festival “Night of Joy”. The show had attracted thousands of families and church youth groups to the famed resort for 35 years now and it featured some of the top names in genre including Amy Grant, Steven Curtis Chapman and Michael W. Smith. However, Disney World canceled the music festival without a favourable answer to the public. “Last year was our last event. “This development is part of our philosophy to continually changing our offerings,” a spokesperson told the Sentinel. The event’s Facebook page has already been deleted. Reports say MercyMe and Tauren Wells are scheduled to perform at Epcot later this year. A number of Christian music fans posted their frustration and disappointment at the news on Facebook. “Seriously, Disney? So wrong on so many levels,” one fan wrote. “For those who love Disney, this is sad.” “This is not the Walt Disney that Walt Disney created,” wrote another critic. “Disney World used to be family oriented but not anymore. “Walt is probably rolling over in his grave. Others wondered why Disney World gave priority to certain special interest groups but chose to cancel a faith-based show.

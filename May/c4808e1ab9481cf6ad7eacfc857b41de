Nigeria Football Federation boss Amaju Pinnick has stated that they are doing everything possible to motivate the Super Eagles stars before their trip to Russia for the 2018 World Cup. The Nigerian Federation have made a request to FIFA for an advance payment of 2.8 million dollars (around N1 billion) to pay the national team players their bonus for qualifying for the tournament in Russia and they will receive the money next week at the start of their training camp. ‘’We are going to give them luxury chartered from one point to the other during our friendlies, luxury accommodation which we have done. Everything that we need to do we have done,’’ Pinnick told Channels Television. ‘’As I speak we are on the verge of raising 2.8 million dollars, as soon as they come we hand it over to them.
‘’I recall when we landed in London, Onazi came to me and said ‘president you guys are setting us up, so you people just want us to take all the blame’.’’

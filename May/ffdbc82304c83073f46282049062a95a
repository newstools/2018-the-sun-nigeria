Former Abia State governor and chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu, has urged the Muslim Ummah to use the holy month of Ramadan to offer prayers for President Muhammadu Buhari and Nigeria. According to him, the teaching of the Holy Qur’an and qualities of Prophet Mohammed (SAW) should be emulated by the Muslim faithful beyond Ramadan. In a statement signed by his Special Adviser, Alhaji Kunle Oyewumi, Kalu called for religious tolerance and mutual respect among people of different religious beliefs. “I congratulate our Muslim brothers and sisters on yet another Ramadan. It is a season of spiritual rebirth and self-appraisal in the service of God and humanity. This period should be used to offer prayers for the nation. “The acts of piety, forgiveness, selflessness and togetherness should be demonstrated and upheld in this holy month and beyond.” The former governor, while wishing Muslims a fulfilling Ramadan, urged them to extend the gesture of the holy month to people of other religions, and added that Nigeria is blessed as a multi-religious country.

Emma Jemegah A total sum of N65 million was shared among the Nigerian medalists and coaches at the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Queensland, Australia which held between April 4-15 this year, the Minister of Youth and Sports, Barrister Solomon Dalung has stated. The minister, in a chat with journalists in Lagos, Thursday said all the gold medalists received $5,000 each while the silver medalist got $3,000 and the bronze medalists $2000 each while an undisclosed amount went to the coaches, making a total $182000. Barrister Dalung said the Queensland Games was an improved performance on the 2014 held in Glasgow, adding that athletes conformed themselves well at the Games. “There were no issues at the Games because the athletes got their winning bonuses on time. We are satisfied with our performance but it could be better,” he said. The Minister added that unlike previous Games, the athletes at the Commonwealth Games came out clean in all the doping tests conducted on them. “Our anti-doping agency conducted 100 tests before the games while the Commonwealth agency conducted tests on 18 of our athletes but they all came out clean. And I want to commend the athletes for not soiling the image of the country in Australia,” the Minister said.

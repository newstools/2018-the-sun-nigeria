The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has said that competitive markets are the cornerstone of a vibrant telecommunications industry as they encourage innovations and foster efficiency. The commission said this in Lagos at the stakeholders’ forum on the study of the level of competition in the Nigeria telecoms industry. According to the director, Policy Competition and Economic Analysis, NCC, Ms. Josephine Amuwa, who represented the executive vice chairman, NCC,  Umar Garba Danbatta, in recognition of the importance of competition, the commission periodically conducts studies to assess its impact on the industry, in line with its mandate of creating an enabling environment for competition among operators in the industry as well as ensuring the provision of qualitative and efficient telecommunication services throughout the country. Amuwa recalled that the NCC, in the exercise of its regulatory functions as provided for under the Nigerian Communication Act (NCA), 2003, engaged the consulting firm KPMG Professional Services to conduct a study on the Assessment of the Level of Competition in the Nigerian Telecommunications Industry in 2013. “The outcome of that assessment resulted in the definition of relevant market segments and a determination of dominance in some of those market segments. “Following the success of the 2013 determination and activities in the telecoms industry since then, it became necessary to conduct another assessment of the competition in the market. As such, the commission has engaged the services of Messer’s CT Worx Limited to conduct a study on the Level of Competition in the Nigerian Telecommunications Industry, using the 2013 as baseline year,” she said.
Amuwa noted that the overall objective of the study was to “provide current insight into the level of competition in the telecommunications market and articulate strategies/ recommendations to enhance opportunities in the market and to ensure the deepening of competition resulting in the provision of innovative services to consumers.”  Click Here>>>>>>Anti-kidnap and anti-theft device for tracking and listening<<<<<<

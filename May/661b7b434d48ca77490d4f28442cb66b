Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja Personal Assistant to the President on Social Media, Lauretta Onochie, has reacted to claims by Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike that the Federal Government was planning to assassinate him. Onochie, via her Twitter handle, @laurestar, said the Governor is being haunted by the blood of the innocent state indigenes he has shed since 2015. She tweeted that Wike ordinarily should be in a “health institution” and not in charge of the state, and called on citizens to vote him out in the next elections. Wike made the allegation on Sunday during a church thanksgiving in Port Harcourt, the state capital, as well as on Channels TV Monday morning. Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, had on Sunday in reaction said, “Codeine-induced allegations fly everywhere now. It even needs no response. “People should not judge this Presidency by their own standards.” Onochie, in her tweets said, “The @sunrisedailynow team are asking all the right questions, but they are dealing with Gov. Nyesom Wike aren’t they! “He’s a man haunted by the blood of the innocent he has shed since 2015. “To survive, the people of Rivers state must come together to uproot this paranoid Governor. “It’s sad that a man who should be receiving care, sympathy and attention in a health institution is sitting as a governor of Rivers state. Our laws must be changed to give citizens the rights to demand mental assessment of their leaders. Sadly, the people of Ekiti lived through it.”

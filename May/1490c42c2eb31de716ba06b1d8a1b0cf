Tony John, Port Harcourt People Democratic Party (PDP), Rivers State chapter, has reiterated its resolve to work for the reelection of  Governor Nyesom Wike, in 2019. The party has also declared that it would win the 23 chairmanship seats in the June 16, local government elections. Chairman of PDP in the State, Felix Obuah, while speaking at the flag-off campaign, on Sunday, in Ikwerre Local Government, described Governor Wike as a democrat. Obuah disclosed that PDP was satisfied with the developmental strides he has recorded since he assumed office in 2015. He charged PDP supporters across the 23 LGAs to mobilise  from ward to ward, unit to unit to campaign for their candidates for the June 16 elections and in 2019 Obuah said, “I have been moving from one local government to another, I have not seen anyone coordinated as Ikwerre. I appreciate leader of the LGA on how you produced your candidates without rancour. “Wike is a democrat. He has shown what leadership is all about. Anybody who has done well deserves our support, so we need to come out en masse and vote him to continue. Vote for PDP in the LGA and state elections if you want the party in the state.” However, the chairmanship candidate of the PDP in Ikwerre Local Government,  and immediate past Publicity Secretary of PDP,  Samuel Nwanosike, noted that no force can stop the reelection of Wike in 2019. Nwanosike said: “I want to thank God for what He has done for us. I send a message to the new executive of the opposition in the state that in Rivers State we are all warriors. “No man can intimidate us. PDP will win in the 300 wards of the state in 2019 because Governor Nyesom Wike has worked for us. “We will continue to vote PDP. We will resist anyone who plans to use federal influence to avert the will of the people with the force of the masses. “Whether we like it or not, Wike will be Rivers governor in 2019. We are going to work for his victory”, Nwanosike declared.

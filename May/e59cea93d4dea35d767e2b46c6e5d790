Fred Ezeh, Abuja The Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC) has strengthened its partnership with London-based educational publisher, Jolly Phonics, to improve basic education in Nigeria. The partnership had facilitated the training of over 50,000 teachers in public schools across 31 states in Nigeria and also reached out to approximately 3.5 million children with learning materials. A statement by the UBEC spokesman, Ossom Ossom, highlighted how children taught by Jolly Phonics trained teachers had significant academic improvement above those taught by teachers who have not been exposed to the jolly phonics method. He said that UBEC Executive Secretary, Dr. Hamid Bobboyi, was delighted that the partnership has yielded the expected result. “UBEC is proud of the achievements of the Jolly Phonics project as noted in the most recent impact report provided to us by Universal Learning Solutions. “Whilst there is still much work to do if we are to address the high levels of illiteracy, it is clear that this project has delivered success and helped UBEC attain its vision of delivering access to a quality education,” he said.

Billy Graham Abel, Yola At least 30 people were feared dead as a group of armed herdsmen, numbering over 400, attacked and burnt down five villages, Bolki, Bang, Nzumoso, Boki and Gon, in Numan and Lamurde local government areas of Adamawa State, local sources told Daily Sun yesterday. The killers were said to have arrived the communities Wednesday night on motorcycles and in pick-up vans and began killing and burning down houses in the villages. A source inside Numan said there were only two Hilux trucks of military personnel when the armed herdsmen arrived and the soldiers failed to engage the armed herdsmen on sighting them. “The soldiers retreated into town while the herdsmen spilled blood all over the place,” the source said, lamenting that two air force fighter jets also flew over the town before the attack but they also failed to engage the herdsmen.
It was also gathered that the herdsmen chased escaping locals towards the nearby river and might have killed more people in the river.

It was indeed a night to remember, as different shades of fun were unlocked at the Castle Lite Unlocks concert held last Friday at Eko Hotels and Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos. Headlined by multi-platinum selling American rapper, J Cole and a host of Nigerian stars including Davido, Wizkid and Tiwa Savage, the Castle Lite Unlocks concert had the audience thrilled with so much music on a dazzling but chilled stage. It was really a night of glitz, glamour and great tunes, combined with ice-cold Castle Lite beer. Hosted by Do2dtun and South Africa’s Pearl Thusi, the show opened with a 10-minute battle amongst DJs Obi, Xclusive, Neptune and Jimmy Jatt, with all of them delivering performances that amazed the audience. MI, Ycee, Falz Davido, Wizkid and Tiwa Savage later thrilled the guests, as they rapped and sang along. And the moment finally came… The lights were dimed and audiences went gaga with the announcement of J Cole, who then mounted the stage dressed in Nigerian colours and soaking in all the love he was been given by the audience. He went on to captivate the audience by performing songs off his latest album, KOD, which was released a couple of days before. The excitement in the air was palpable, as fans rushed towards the stage dancing and gyrating to the tunes. Speaking at the event, Franscoe Bouwer, Castle Lite Marketing Manager, said: “Castle Lite breaks boundaries and music is a natural fit with the brand’s DNA.  We also appreciate the fact that it represents the biggest passion point for our consumers’ lives, hence we are always committed to unlocking memorable fan experiences and creating shared value for all our consumers with concerts like this.”

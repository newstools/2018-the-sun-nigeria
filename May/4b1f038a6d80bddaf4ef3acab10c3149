Bamigbola Gbolagunte, Akure The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ondo State again held a parallel congress to elect executive members of the party at the ward level. In Akure South Local Government Area, the congress was held at two venues with a member representing Akure federal constituency in the House of Representatives, Hon Afe Olowookere leading a faction, while the Secretary to the State Government, Mr Ifedayo Abegunde led another faction. Similar situation was also reported in Akure North, Akoko South West, Akoko North East and Ondo West Local Government Areas among others. Sunday Sun gathered that the parallel congresses were occasioned by the leadership crisis rocking the party in the state. Hon Olowookere alleged that Governor Rotimi Akeredolu was doing everything to highjack the party structure, hence the resolve of some leaders of the party to hold a parallel congress. He declared that his faction was the authentic one recognized by the national secretariat of the party, adding that the congress conducted by his faction was the recognized one. But Abegunde noted that the leadership of the party at both the state and national level gave recognition to his faction, adding that the congress, which his faction held, was supervised by representatives of the national secretariat of the party. In his reaction, the state chairman of the party, Mr Ade Adetimehin said the party is a united family, notwithstanding the differences.

Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja President Muhammadu Buhari is back in Abuja, a day before he was scheduled to return from his medical trip to the United Kingdom. He told reporters on arrival that, “I just went for a checkup. I am now okay.” He was expected back Saturday, May 12, but he arrived Friday at 6:47 p.m. On hand to receive him were the Chief of Staff Abba Kyari, Minister of Federal Capital Territory Mohammed Bello, among other top government functionaries and presidential aides. A statement released on Monday and signed by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, had stated that the President was expected back on Saturday, May 12. He had also said that, on his return, the President is expected to embark on a two-day state scheduled visit to Jigawa, which was postponed earlier as a result of the APC Ward Congresses. The President had left Nigeria late Tuesday evening, after receiving Letters of Credence from some diplomats, to undertake a four-day trip to the United Kingdom. This medical trip makes it the third in 2018 alone, the first being the nine-day visit just before the recent Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in that country, and the second during the technical stop over in London on his way to Nigeria from his recent visit to the United States on the invitation of President Donald Trump.

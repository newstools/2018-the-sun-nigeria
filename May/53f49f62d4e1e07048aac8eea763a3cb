This week to mark Children’s Day, as the British High Commission and Super Eagles players visited children at the Modern Secondary School GRA, Port Harcourt. In a momentous day for the children, Super Eagles players William Troost-Ekong and Leon Balogun gave Premier League kits donated by the UK’s Royal Air Force Football Association’s ‘Taking football to Africa and Beyond’ appeal. The players answered the children’s questions and heard their hopes and aspirations for the future. Defender Troost-Ekong told the children that he had always loved football and with hard work, dedication and support from his parents he was delighted to have made it to the top. Balogun, who recently joined Premier League club Brighton & Hove Albion, advised the children on the importance of education – that they should work hard at school and not give up on their dreams. The boys and girls were delighted to test out their own football skills and the players were blown away by an outstanding performance of the Nigerian National Anthem. Head teacher Mrs Ivanhoe Boma J. was filled with gratitude thanking the players for giving up their time to inspire her children.  The teachers were thrilled and thanked the British High Commission and Nigerian Football Federation for helping to celebrate Children’s Day. The UK is committed to youth development, through its UK aid suite of projects, Chevening and Commonwealth programmes. The Royal Air Force ‘Taking Football to Africa and Beyond’ appeal was set up in 2006 and collects donated football shirts from UK clubs and sends them to Africa. Later this week to further celebrate Nigeria’s youth, the British High Commission  Abuja will host a tournament including former Super Eagles and Super Falcons players and visit school children from local communities.

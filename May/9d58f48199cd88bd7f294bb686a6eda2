•Says NFF open to criticisms Joe Apu President of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Amaju Pinnick has allays fears that the injury situation within the Super Eagles could affect the team’s performance at the World Cup. Speaking in Lagos yesterday, Pinnick stated that the federation was in touch with the players and assured that the injury situation is nothing to worry about. “There’s nothing to worry about I can assure you. The NFF is in constant touch with the players on a daily basis and I believe they would be okay by the time the team is heading to the World Cup. That aside, there’s nothing to worry ourselves about because Gernot Rohr has two to three players for every position. Our plans are on track. “The programme we set for the team is going on according to plans and we’re not relenting to ensure that the Eagles get all they needed to prepare for the World Cup.” On the team’s camping, Pinnick announced that the team would open camp in Uyo, the Akwa Ibom State capital on May 20 before they face Atletico Madrid.
Pinnick noted that his board was open to criticisms as long as they’re constructive. “This board is not averse to criticisms because we’re not perfect. Criticisms are good to help oil the wheels of progress. We welcome such criticisms, so long as they are constructive.”

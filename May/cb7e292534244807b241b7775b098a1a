Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday pledged his government’s support to all Kenyans affected by rain-related calamities. Kenyatta said those affected by floods in various parts of the country and the victims of the collapsed dam tragedy in Nakuru will receive government assistance to both ease their grief and rebuild their lives. “Let the victims of recent calamities know that my government will give every support in this moment of grief and difficulty. So that they can rebuild their lives and livelihood,’’ the president said, who led Kenyans in a one-minute silence in honor of the fallen compatriots. The president spoke in Nairobi where he launched this year’s National Tree Planting Day and the Nairobi Clean-up campaign. Kenyatta announced that an extra 10 million dollars would be made available to the Kenya Red Cross to continue with its relief work, in addition to the 15 million dollars already set aside for this purpose.
“Indeed, every family in the Republic that has lost a loved one can rely on a similar guarantee from my government. We will stand with you; we will pray with you; we will support you. Wherever you are in the country, we are with you,’’ he said. The East African nation has been facing ongoing floods, on Wednesday; the Patel dam in Solai area of Nakuru county, 190 km north-west of Nairobi burst its banks after heavy rains, killing no fewer than 45 people. The president said following the rain-related havoc, the government had responded well in rescuing marooned Kenyans, providing water, food and essential medicines and restoring water systems and sanitation where necessary. Kenyatta said the floods had affected 32 counties, left over 170 people dead, and displaced another 332,000 in addition to the destruction of property and infrastructure.
The current flooding is likely to continue as heavy rainfall is forecast to continue for the coming weeks in the region.

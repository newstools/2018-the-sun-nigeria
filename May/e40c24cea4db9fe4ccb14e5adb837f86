As the 2018 Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) election gathers momentum, President of the National Associational of Nigeria Footballer (NANF), Harrison Jalla has urged the body to settle all rift before the forthcoming election of the body. The election which is billed for October 2018 will see the incumbent president, Amaju Pinnick gunning for a second term. It was recalled that the Pinnick led regime are currently battling a case in the court of law following the appeal of his contestant, Chris Giwa who emerged a factional president of the football body.
Jalla, in an interview with Sunday Sun, revealed that there is need for the NFF to carry out proper cleansing in order to achieve a free and fair election. â€œIn my opinion, the composition of the NFF Electoral committee does not really matter. My concern is that whether they can function. Having not resolved the crisis that emanated from the NFF 2010 election and the 2014 NFF Warri election. Am not sure this current electoral committee can organise any credible election if issues surrounding the two previous elections are not resolved to the satisfaction of all and aggrieved parties with necessary reforms in place.

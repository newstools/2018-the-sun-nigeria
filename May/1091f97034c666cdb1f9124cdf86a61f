NAN Multiple Olympic sprint champion Usain Bolt is training with Norwegian top-flight side Stromsgodset as he pursues his dream of becoming a professional footballer, newspaper Verdens Gang reported on Wednesday. The 31-year-old Jamaican, who retired from athletics after winning eight Olympic gold medals, is a soccer fanatic and trained with the club in Drammen, some 40km south-west of Oslo, earlier on Wednesday. He also hopes to play some part in a friendly against the club’s Under-19 side. “I want to try to get better, to work as hard as I can, play as much as I can. “Maybe a club will see something and decide to give me a chance,” said Bolt, who hung up his spikes after last year’s world championships in London. Stromsgodset sporting director, Jostein Flo said Bolt was given shirt number 9.58 – his world record time for the 100 metres – to wear during his time at the club. Flo added that he may get a chance to play in a game to show what he can do. The Stromsgodset players were surprised to find the world’s fastest man in their dressing room on Wednesday, Flo said. “We told them a player was coming to try out and that he was damn fast – the door opened, and Bolt came in. “It was a shock for them, they couldn’t believe it,” Flo added. A Manchester United fan, Bolt also trained with Bundesliga club Borussia Dortmund in March.

Oghenekaro Etebo has been ruled out of Las Palmas’s last away match of the season against Eibar at the Estadio Municipal de Ipurúa on Saturday, Allnigeriasoccer.com reported. The Nigeria national-teamer had not been able to participate in training due to a muscular discomfort ahead of the trip to the Basque Country and it was confirmed that he would not be named in Las Palmas provisional roster. The Clube Desportivo Feirense loanee is expected to resume full training with Las Palmas early next week and hoped to make himself available for selection against Girona a week on Saturday. The Super Eagles treatment room was beginning to overflow, five days before manager Gernot Rohr announces his anticipated provisional World Cup roster, as Joel Obi (Torino), Wilfred Ndidi (Leicester City) and Tyronne Ebuehi (ADO Den Haag) are still receiving treatment.
In addition, question marks had been hanging over the match fitness of Everton loanee, Henry Onyekuru, Mainz defender, Leon Balogun and Monaco loanee, Elderson Echiejile. On a positive note, assistant captain, Eddy Onazi and Arsenal’s Alex Iwobi had put their injury worries behind them and had returned to action for their respective clubs.

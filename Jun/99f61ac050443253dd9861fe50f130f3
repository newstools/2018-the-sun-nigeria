Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja President Muhammadu Buhari has charged the Super Eagles to sustain the momentum of their victory Friday over the national team of Iceland in their second match of the Russia 2018 FIFA World Cup. This is even as he has urged all Nigerians to continue to rally round the country’s ambassadors with their prayers and other forms of support. The Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, in a statement said, Buhari while congratulating the Super Eagles, expressed delight at the confidence, discipline, team-work and indomitable spirit displayed by the young Nigerian players. The President urged them not to limit themselves but sustain the current winning momentum by going all out against their last group opponent, Argentina, next week. According to him, “I am confident that if our players believe in themselves, they can qualify out of their difficult group and even go very far in the tournament,” adding that “with determination, nothing is impossible.”

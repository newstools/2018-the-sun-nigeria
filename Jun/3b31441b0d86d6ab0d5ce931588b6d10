Dear Njigirl, My husband is very childish. He is 35 and I am 28. We met while I was in my last year of college and have been together ever since. There is no doubt in mind that I love him but I don’t know if I can live with his behavior for the rest of my life. He does not take anything serious while I am the queen of “prim and proper.” Look, I am tired of his attitude and playfulness. Some of the things he does that bother me are playing “hide and seek” with say my workbag or my shoes when I am already running late.
ANGELA Dear Angela, Your husband sounds like a happy go lucky kind of fella who does not allow life’s problems to weigh him down. You are lucky in some ways because he will not be admitted in the hospital for high blood pressure. You on the other hand may suffer high blood pressure the way that you are going. Learn to not take yourself too seriously and just go with his flow sometimes. Having said that I am sure that it is no fun searching for your workbag when you are five minutes away from missing the train to town. Gently let him know that although you appreciate his sense of humour, the hide and seek with your work items on weekdays are not acceptable. Gently lay down rules that are not too hard to keep and try to emulate some of his playful attitude. I admit that when a guy is too playful it can be very annoying. Some guys try too hard to please their women and frankly when the playfulness is not balanced or appears forceful, it really puts off women. So I can understand where your guy takes it too far. You need to sort of let him know when enough is enough. Still, humour is important in a relationship. It makes life go by faster when you can laugh with your partner. There are some people that will not date a guy who does not have the ability to make them laugh. This is how they measure compatibility. You are still lucky that your guy has a sense of humor. It is just that you need to prune it here and there.  Enjoy him while you still can. Dr. Nj

Nigeria manager, Gernot Rohr is worried that Barcelona’s Argentina superstar, Lionel Messi will cause his team problems when they face off at the 2018 World Cup. The German reckoned that everything would be different at the Krestovsky Stadium, Saint Petersburg on June 26, compared to their 4-2 win in Krasnodar last November. The Super Eagles would be seeking to make history, as they had never beaten the Argentinian team in four previous tournaments, losing in 1994, 2002, 2010 and 2014. ‘’It was a great match, but we cannot let go. They did not have Messi and someone else. We did not have Victor Moses. It will be very different,’’ Rohr said to Spanish sports daily Marca. Asked about Nigeria’s other opponents in Group D, Rohr answered: ‘’Iceland and Croatia have the same dream of passing the group stage and Argentina is one of the favorites for the title.

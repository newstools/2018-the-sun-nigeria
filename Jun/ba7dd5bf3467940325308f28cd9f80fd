Gyang Bere, Jos The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Plateau State has described the ruling by the Federal High Court, Abuja that sentenced former Governor of the state, Senator Joshua Dariye, to 14 years imprisonment as a landmark judgement and victory against corruption. Public Reactions Officer of the Party, Hon. John Akans disclosed this in a telephone interview with Daily Sun in Jos and said it was time for the party to reclaim its stolen mandate from APC. Justice Adebukola Banjoko of the FCT High Court had found Dariye guilty of 15 of the 23 criminal charges leveled against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) during his administration as governor of the state between 1999 and 2007. Hon. Akans said the party decided not to dragged Dariye to Court when he defected to the All Progressive Congress (APC) with the mandate of PDP because it was established that he will not escape jail. “This is the hour we in the PDP have all been waiting for, the law has taken it course, it was a landmark judgement that has created an avenue for PDP to reclaim its stolen mandate. “We gave Dariye overwhelming vote during the 2015 Senatorial elections in the state and he won the election under the platform of PDP but he disappointed the party by jumping to the ruling APC in search of refuge following his corrupt cases in court. No matter how long the case will take there must be a judgement day and today is the day of judgement.” Hon. Akans said the judgement has vindicated the people of Plateau Central Senatorial Zone whom Dariye misused their mandate and said the people now have another opportunity to elect their choice.

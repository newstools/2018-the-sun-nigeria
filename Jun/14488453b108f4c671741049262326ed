Iceland captain Aron Gunnarsson is convinced Group D in the World Cup will be decided by fine margins ahead of his side’s clash with Nigeria in Volgograd on Friday. Iceland claimed a hard-fought 1-1 draw against group favourites Argentina in their first match, and with Nigeria losing to Croatia, victory for either side could prove decisive in progressing to the knockout stages. Gunnarsson said Iceland would build on their performance against Argentina, stressing the importance of the collective to their hopes of success against Nigeria, while ramping up the pressure on their African opponents. “I’ve always said that when everyone is rowing in the same direction then anything is possible in football,” said Gunnarsson, who led Iceland to the quarterfinals of the 2016 European Championships in France. “This is a must-win game for Nigeria, and that makes it a little bit psychologically different, they have to win,” he said. “This group is going to be decided in the last minutes, in the last game. “It’s going to be down to some margins, a set piece, a goal in injury time. This is how this group is going to be played.”

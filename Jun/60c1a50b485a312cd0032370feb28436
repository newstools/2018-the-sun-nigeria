D’Tigers held their first training session ahead of the 2019 FIBA Men’s World Cup qualifiers at the Indoor Sports Hall of the National Stadium in Lagos under the tutelage of Alex Nwora and his assistant, Ogoh Odaudu. The nine players made up of Emenago Obinna, Omoerah Keith Saido, Braxton Ogbueze Jai, Mbamalu Bryant, Agada Caleb Apochi, Moses Kingsley, Mehinti Tosin and Okosun Obehioye had a light workout with special focus on offensive moves and ball works. According to Nwora, tomorrow’s (Thursday) training will be more comprehensive and explosive with the arrival of three members of the team on Wednesday evening. Team captain Ike Diogu who currently plays for Sichun Blue Wales in China flew in from his base as well as Zanna Talib from Italy. One of the oldest members of the team who was part of the 2015 Afrobasket winning squad, Aminu Abdul Alade who currently plays for Nanterre of France has also arrived and is expected to be part of training. The arrival of the three experienced players brings the numbers of players in camp to 11 with Jordan Nwora, Akindele Ayodeji, Lawal Olasheni and Ben Uzoh still being expected. Speaking at the end of their training session, Nwora expressed satisfaction with the physical condition of the players. “We have seen some of the boys and we are trying to shape them into what we are looking for. It’s too early to say how soon the team can be in top shape, because this is our first training session.” The team will hold another training session at 9am.

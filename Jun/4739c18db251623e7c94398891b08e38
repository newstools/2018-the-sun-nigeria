Musician cum actor, Bankole Wellington aka Banky W, has revealed how he managed to fight and conquer cancer, just before his wedding to his heartthrob, actress Adesua Etomi. The EME boss, who was just made the ambassador for Pink Oak Trust, said God and availability of sufficient funds saw him through. He said: “Many people know about my own battles with cancer. I’m forever grateful to God that I am alive and well, and that I was able to fund the treatment I needed. Unfortunately, over 90,000 Nigerians die every year due to cancer. This is simply because they can’t afford to fight it. Treatment is expensive and so many people die because they’re just unable to pay for surgery, pills, chemo etc. That has to change, and the more of us that contribute, the better. It would be great if one person donated N100 million. But it would be just as great, and even more powerful, if one million people gave N100 each.”

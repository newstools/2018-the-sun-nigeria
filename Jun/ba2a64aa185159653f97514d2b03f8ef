Ekiti State Governor, Ayodele Fayose, has urged former President Olusegun Obasanjo to submit himself for probe rather than raising unnecessary alarm. In a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Idowu Adelusi, Fayose argued that Obasanjo cannot make his predicament a Yoruba issue. “To me, former President Obasanjo should submit himself for probe and trial. He gave us the impression that he is a brave man who is not afraid of anything. He is a retired general in the army who has seen a lot and should not be raising alarms now. Obasanjo said Buhari was the best for Nigeria while promoting him for the 2015 general elections,” he stated. Fayose added: “In his book ‘Under My Watch’, Obasanjo said he prefers to be jailed by Buhari rather than former President Goodluck Jonathan being reelected into office. Now prison is beckoning on him and he wants to dodge. He set up the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) and among others. He even used those bodies to hound and lock up many people including state governors. Why is he now afraid of being probed. “Let him tell Nigerians how he made his money. People can recollect the level he was before he became president and how he left office. If Buhari is now telling the whole world that Obasanjo stole money, it is incumbent on Obasanjo to prove his innocence.”

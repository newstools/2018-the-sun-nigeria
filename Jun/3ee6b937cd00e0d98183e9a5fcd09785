Wole Balogun, Ado Ekiti Former Kano State Governor Alhaji Rabiu Kwankwaso and Ekiti State Governor Ayodele Fayose have called for the credible and peaceful conduct of the upcoming July 14 governorship election in Ekiti State. Both men spoke in Ado-Ekiti during a call by Kwankwaso on Fayose at the Government House Monday. This was contained in a press statement by Fayoseâ€™s Chief Press Secretary, Mr Idowu Adelusi. Kwankwaso, currently serving as an APC senator, addressing the northern community in the state, urged them to live in peace with their hosts and exercise their civic duties during the election. He said elections should not be seen as war, but that the votes of the people must be made to count. Kwankwaso, decrying the spate of killings in some parts of the country, stated that it was the responsibility of the government to secure the lives and properties of citizens. Asked whether he would defect to the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the former Minister of Defence said whatever was collectively agreed upon by members of the New PDP would inform his next line of action. In his remarks, Governor Fayose thanked the senator for the visit. He added that peace was imperative for the unity and corporate existence of the country. He lambasted the Federal Government for not being able to curtail the killings going on in the country.

Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja The Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting presided over by President Muhammmadu Buhari, yesterday, held valedictory session in honour of Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Kayode Fayemi, who resigned as a cabinet member. This was just as Buhari assured Fayemi that cabinet members will be in Ekiti for his inauguration as governor. “Goodby; we will come for the inauguration,” he told Fayemi as he shook his hand to bid him farewell.
Fayemi quit the cabinet to contest the July 14 governorship election in Ekiti State. He is the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress for the Ekiti State election. Buhari, at a valedictory session in Fayemi’s honour before the commencement of the cabinet meeting, described him as “a man of sound intellect, whose contributions helped the administration achieve progress, especially in the solid minerals sector.” The President again canvassed for voter education so that people would get their Permanent Voters Card to elect candidates of their choice, at all levels. Buhari recalled that the introduction of PVC accompanied by electronic accreditation of voters by the past administration for the 2015 elections saved him from another electoral defeat.

Oba Ademolaju said, “We don’t want war and if we say there should be no war, then there should be no cheating. “Don’t put Ekiti into trouble, go and campaign tell people what you want to do. Some people are fond of removing other people posters and billboards, anybody who causes evil, evil will return to the person in the name of our ancestors. “We don’t want the repeat of 1983. Ekiti does not like cheating, if you don’t like it, then don’t engage in it. There will always be another four years. Therefore this election must not be a do or die affair,” said Oba Ademolaju.

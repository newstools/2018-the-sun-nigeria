Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, has assured participants drawn from the state in the Youths Empowered Nigeria Workshop Programme that the state government will support the setting up of two additional firms from the pool of best ideas from the participants. Obaseki, who said this while declaring open the workshop organised by Nigeria Bottling Company (NBC) Limited, in Benin, the Edo State capital, noted that of the two firms the state intends to support, one would be exclusive for women. He said: “We have set aside some funds to support you. We will provide you with the opportunity to create two companies, with one of the companies to be exclusive for women.”
Noting that the state is poised for growth, Obaseki said the best way to achieve sustainable development is to look inwards and create opportunities for people to realise their full potential. “Through the state government’s various skills development programmes, we will continue to support and encourage youths to improve talents required for sustainable development. “If youths, under 32 years, who make up 65 percent of Nigeria’s population, are assisted to discover and improve their talents, Nigeria will become better for it,” he said. Obaseki described the workshop organised by the NBC as crucial and assured that his administration will continue to create opportunities for youths to acquire skills and match them with existing job opportunities through the EdoJobs portal.

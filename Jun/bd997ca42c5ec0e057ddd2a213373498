The Senior Men’s National 3×3 Team today left Nigeria for the 2018 FIBA 3×3 World Cup holding in Philippines between the 8th and 12th of June. The 4-man team which departed from the Murtala Mohammed International Airport aboard a Qatar Airways flight was led by the Director of 3×3 Nigeria, Frank Jituboh. The players are Azuoma Dike, David Godwin and Lucky Subel all from Kano Pillars Basketball Club and captain, Yahaya Abdul. The captain expressed optimism that Nigeria, the current African Champions can make an impression despite making their world cup debut. “We have been in camp in Abuja for the last 3 weeks and we are prepared for the task ahead. We are in high spirit and ready to bring more honor to Nigeria.” Yahaya said the experience they garnered in Togo during the FIBA Africa 3 Championship where they defeated Congo in the finals to win the title has prepared them for the challenges ahead in Manila, Philippines. Jituboh thanked the Nigeria Basketball Federation under the leadership of Engineer Musa Kida for total support given to the team. “Kida was the first person who saw the 3×3 vision and decided to invest in it through his AMK foundation when he was not even the President. I am not surprised that as the president of NBBF, he has continued to support the latest basketball format which has continued to grow.” The team is in group D alongside Ukraine, Croatia, Jordan and Latvia. They are expected to play 2 matches against Ukraine and Croatia while on Sunday, it will be an encounter against Jordan and Latvia to determine their quarter final fate.

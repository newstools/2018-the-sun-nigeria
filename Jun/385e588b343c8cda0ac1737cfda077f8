• Ranked 19th most expensive team in the world Joe Apu Nigeria’s Super Eagles to the Russia 2018 World Cup is valued at $154 million which is in the region of N5.5 billion. This is according to a recent survey carried out on the 32 teams at this summer’s World Cup, which starts on Thursday in Moscow. Using data from football data site Transfermarkt, analysts at Dutch bank ING have calculated that around £9 billion ($12 billion) will be on show at the tournament, with Spain being the most valuable team — it’s worth more than £900 million ($1.2 billion). Though, Nigeria is the third highest valued team on the African continent, the Eagles are placed 19th according to the data with Egypt and Senegal valued at $231.4 million (17th) and $331.6 million (11th) respectively.
Big European and South American sides dominate the upper echelons of player worth, while minnows like Panama and Saudi Arabia dwell at the bottom end of the charts. In fact, the world’s top three players — Neymar, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo — are worth more than the nine least valuable teams combined, ING calculated. “Some say the football market is highly inflated — and it’s certainly astonishing to see the significant increase in team values from the last World Cup,” Ian Bright, a senior economist at ING said. “But whether you truly get value for money is a question that only fans can answer.” Below is how much every squad at the World Cup is worth. 1.

Rangers will face either Petrocub or Osijek if they successfully overcome Macedonian side Shkupi in the first qualifying round, which takes place on July 12 and July 19, while Hibernian will play Asteras Tripolis if they defeat Runavik. The winner of the tie between Cliftonville and Nordsjaelland will face either Shamrock Rovers or AIK, while Coleraine will play Sparta Prague if they can get the better of Spartak Subotica. Connah’s Quay face the prospect of meeting Lech Poznan if they can overcome Shakhtyor Soligorsk and the Polish giants can beat Gandzasar-Kapan.

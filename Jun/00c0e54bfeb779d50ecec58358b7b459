Akwa Ibom State government has taken delivery of new sets of equipment-carrying containers for the on-going reconstruction of Eket Township Stadium, Eket, and the remodeling of Uyo Township Stadium, Uyo. Receiving the equipment, Tuesday, at Godswill Akpabio Stadium, Uyo, the state Commissioner for Youth and Sports, Sir Monday Uko, said more containers were expected from abroad. He said the reconstruction process was in its final phase and expressed optimism at getting the project ready for commissioning this September. He listed the items received to include multiple unites of 55mm-thick Synthetic Grass Layers, Tartan Track Granules, Astro Turf Underlays and Non-Galvanized nails. Others are multiple deniers of Fibre Tufts, Envirofill, Fibre Nylons and Silica Sands. He expressed gratitude to Akwa Ibom State’s multiple sports award-winning Governor, Udom Emmanuel, who approved the twin-project last year, for his enduring proclivity toward sports development in the State and pledged his commitment to deliver a world-class facility upon completion. It would be recalled that Governor Udom Emmanuel had, last year, approved the reconstruction of Eket Stadium and remodeling of Uyo Township Stadium, with both projects intended to provide alternatives to the Godswill Akpabio International Stadium. The new Eket Stadium is expected to be a 21st-Century compliant, 17000-seating capacity edifice complete with floodlights, indoor sports hall and artificial playing turf.

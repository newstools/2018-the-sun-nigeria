Linus Oota, Lafia Speaker, Nasarawa State House of Assembly, Balarabe Abdullahi, has described President Mohammadu Buhari as a hero of democracy for assenting to the law granting financial autonomy to state Houses of Assembly in the country. He said that the decision has placed the president as the best leader the country has produced so far, noting that previous leaders in the country did not bother about the plight of the state lawmakers. The Speaker also commended members of the 8th National Assembly for passing the bill, which granted financial independence to both the state Houses of Assembly and the state judiciary.
He explained that granting independence to the state lawmakers would help to fast track legislative duties without banking on the executive for funding. According to Abdullahi, Buhari would go down in history as the president who granted financial autonomy to state Houses of Assemblies and the judiciary, adding that the gesture has proven that the president was committed to deepening Nigerian democracy.

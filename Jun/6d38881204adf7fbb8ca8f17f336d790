Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri A replica of the Ahiara Catholic dioceses crisis may be played out in the Diocese of Owerri (Anglican Communion) following the retirement of Right, Reverend  Cyril Okorocha and subsequent installation of a three man committee appointed by the retiring cleric. According to a reliable source, appointment of the three man committee by the outgoing bishop did not go down well with  Primate of the Church of Nigeria and Metropolitan Bishop, Most Reverend Nicholas Okoh who was said to have been informed by Okorocha before his exit. Sunday Sun further reliably gathered that Primate Okoh subsequently appointed the Bishop of Ikeduru diocese, Right Reverend Emmanuel Maduwuike to take over the management of the diocese for the meantime pending the when a new priest would be duly appointed . Presently, crisis brewing in the Dioceses is said to have divided the congregations and priests into two camps as some aggrieved priests has vowed to resist Okorocha’ s committee. They , insist that due process must be followed in the selection of another bishop of the dioceses. The crisis also according to a source has forced worshippers of the cathedral to worship elsewhere rather than the cathedral. Attempt by our our correspondent to speak to any of the clerics proved abortive . A worshipper in the cathedral who do not want his name mentioned appealed to both sides to tread with caution , according to him “unless it degenerates to the Ahiara crisis in Mbaise”.

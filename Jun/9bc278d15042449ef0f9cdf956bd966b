Wole Balogun, Ado Ekiti Chairman of Ekiti State chapter of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Gboyega Oguntuase, has asked the All Progressives Congress’ (APC) candidate in the July governorship election, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, to explain how he spent statutory allocations and other funds which accrued to his administration between 2010 and 2014. Oguntuase said documents from the Office of the Accountant General of the Federation, the National Bureau of Statistics among others, showed  that Fayemi collected N165 billion as  allocations, excluding regular funds from the Excess Crude Oil Account, grants, internally-generated revenues, among others, “but Fayemi still took N25 billion bond and N35 billion commercial loans with nothing to show for the funds.” In a statement  released in Ado-Ekiti, yesterday, Oguntuase also said the Ayodele Fayose administration has done creditably well, despite the lean resources at its disposal. “In 2011, Fayemi got N40.5 billion as monthly statutory allocations. In 2012, he got N39.8 billion. In 2013, he got N44.3 billion and in 2014, he got N40.1 billion. Whereas, the Fayose administration got N28.2 billion in 2015, N18.8 billion in 2016 and N25.6 billion in 2017. “Apart from the above monthly allocations, Fayemi still got regular funds from the Excess Crude Oil Account, IGR among others. Despite what Fayemi got, he still borrowed N25 billion from the Capital Market and took N31 billion commercial loans. The question is, what did he do with the money? Nothing. The N25 billion bond and commercial loans, through which he mortgaged the finances of our state for 20 years, were spent on nothing.” Regardless, Fayemi has challenged Fayose to a public debate on how the state’s resources were expended.
The former governor said how the money was expended are contained in his handover notes.

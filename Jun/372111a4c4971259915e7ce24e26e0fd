Brown Chimezie Eze Ndigbo Mekong River, Thailand, HRH (Amb) Jerome Uzochukwu Ezeneche has call on African leaders to learn from United States President Donald Trump’s handling of North Korea nuclear talks In a statement made available to Daily Sun, Ezeneche said but for his maturity in approaching North Korean leader Kim  Jong-un, plans for the summit would have failed. He commended American Basketball player, Dennis Rodman for urging Kim to yield to dialogue instead of confrontation. Ezeneche said the Basketballer’s intervention  paid  off when Trump again agreed to attend the summit  after he had earlier cancelled it. On what Nigeria in particular can learn from the summit, the royal father said “today, Nigeria is faced with Boko Haram insurgency in the Northeast, militants in the South-south and MASSOB/IPOB crisis in the Southeast, President Muhammad Buhari’s government should engage some of these agitators in dialogue. You may be surprise at what the FG may achieve. Ezeneche attributed the success to Trump to his business acumen.
On tariffs recently imposed on some Western countries that are US long time ally, Ezeneche said time for free lunch and handout is over. He said if Britain could opt out of European Union through Brexit, America too should be free to tax any unprofitable ally.
Ezeneche urged Nigeria to stop playing big brother by carrying all the Financial burden of ECOWAS and AU, while its economy suffers, adding that some of these African countries end up humiliating Nigerians anytime there is civil unrest in their country.

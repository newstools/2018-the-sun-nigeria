Ogenyi Onazi has said that Super Eagles opening’s World Cup Group D match against Croatia today is the team’s World Cup final. Nigeria will tackle the star-studded Croats today’s night by 8pm Nigerian time in Kaliningrad.
“This is the most important game we will play at the World Cup because we wish to take it a game at a time,” the Trabzonspor midfielder reportedly said. “Also, the first game in any tournament is very important, as it will most likely determine how far you can go. “We are the youngest team but these young boys are ready to make a big difference here.”
Onazi is one of only five players on the current Eagles squad who featured at the last World Cup, but he maintained that the target is to at least go past the Round of 16 they achieved four years ago in Brazil. “We want to go past the Round of 16 and afterwards we will see what happens,” he said.
Meanwhile, Russia based ex-Nigeria youth international Kehinde Fatai has revealed that the Super Eagles will get support in Russia during the FIFA World Cup. The Jos-born striker who plays for FC Ufa said there were a good number of Nigeria players in Russia who are loved by Russia football fans and that will earn the Super Eagles more support at Russia 2018. “Eagles will not lack support from fans in Russia. There are good numbers of us playing in Russia and they love and do appreciate us. I am sure they will extend that to the Super Eagles at the World Cup.” Fatai stated. Kehinde Fatai is cutting short his vacation in Nigeria to go cheer Eagles in Russia.
Mikel Obi has in-laws in Russia, Ahmed Musa is an icon in CSKA Moscow, Brian Idowu plays for Amkar Perm, and Sylvester Igboun is Kehinde Fatai’s Teammate at FC Ufa.

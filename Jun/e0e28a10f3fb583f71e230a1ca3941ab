Super Eagles supporters have not been granted permission to carry live chickens to the Kaliningrad Stadium, venue of the national team’s World Cup opener against Croatia on Saturday. It would be recalled that at South Africa 2010, Nigeria fans were turned away from Ellis Park in Johannesburg after demanding to take chickens, painted or dyed green and with bound feet, into the stadium where the team lost 1-0 to Argentina. ‘’Our information center FM-2018 receives a lot of various questions. So, fans from Nigeria asked whether it is possible to go to the stadium with a chicken. This is their symbol, citizens are sick with them in all matches, “ Minister of Culture and Tourism of the region Andrei Ermak was quoted as saying by interfax.ru. “We told them that it’s by no means possible to come with a live chicken. ‘’But if the Nigerians are rooting for their team in other places, we will of course advise them where the chicken can be bought. We are ready to satisfy the most eccentric inquiries.’’ Super Eagles fans believe that the chickens bring good luck to the team.

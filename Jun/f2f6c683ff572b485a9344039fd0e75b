Geoffrey Anyanwu, Awka Five persons (names withheld) are now cooling off in the cell of the Department of State Security (DSS), in Anambra State, following their arrest for alleged diversion of government funds. The suspects, who were arrested during an inspection tour of Ogbaru market by the Anambra State Commissioner for Trade, Commerce, Market and Wealth Creation, Dr. Christian Madubuko, were said to be in the habit of diverting money from government revenue into private pockets with fake receipts. Explaining how the suspects including market leaders were siphoning government funds into their personal pockets, the Commissioner said they issue counterfeit receipts to traders instead of original government receipts. Madubuko, who directed the DSS team that accompanied him on the inspection to arrest the suspects, warned those in charge of government resources to be honest and work in tandem with government policies. He said, “People handling government funds should be mindful of their actions because the state government will deal decisively with anybody caught diverting government’s fund.” The Commissioner called on the general public to report anybody caught indulging in the act of diverting government funds, noting that the government needed money for continuous development of the state. President General of Ogbaru Main Market, Chief Victor Nwawuzie who denied the allegations of diverting government funds listed storage fee, development levy, legal tax and sanitation levy as part of fees the state government authorized him to collect from the traders with issuance of government receipt.

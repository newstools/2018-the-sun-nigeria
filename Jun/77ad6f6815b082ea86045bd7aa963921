Fred Ezeh, Abuja Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI) has approved the Nigeria Strategy for Routine Immunisation and Primary Health Care Systems’ Strengthening (NSIPSS), which is a proposal that would respond to GAVI’s transition in few years. The board also approved additional $3 billion to enable Nigeria provide routine vaccination for its children over the next 10 years. GAVI is expected to make financial commitment of $1.03 billion, while Nigerian government’s contribution is in excess of $1.9 billion. Minister of Health, Prof. Isaac Adewole, told journalists, at a press conference, in Abuja, yesterday, that the approval of the funding envelopes the extension of transitional period from 2021 to 2028, in appreciation of success made, thus far, in Nigeria.
In 2001, Nigerian government and GAVI agreed to strengthen immunisation system. To this end, GAVI supported Nigeria with different life-saving vaccines and additional support for non-vaccine operations. The Executive Director of National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), Dr. Faisal Shuaib, is optimistic that the intervention will herald the realisation of Nigeria’s aspirations as regards immunisation. The Country Director, International Vaccine Access Centre (IVAC), Dr. Chizoba Wonodi, said the strategic plan was designed to improve on immunisation outreach, from 33 to 80 percent in 10 years. She urged Nigerian government to meet its own responsibilities by consistently funding immunisation and primary healthcare services, so they could collectively achieve success.

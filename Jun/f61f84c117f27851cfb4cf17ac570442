Wolves has entered the race for Nigeria’s World Cup star Ahmed Musa, according to reports. Website Turkish-Football cite sources suggesting Galatasaray are confident of signing the Leicester City man. However, they also mentioned reports in Turkish newspaper Fanatik, claiming that the Super Lig champions fear Musa’s form in Russia has alerted rival suitors. The report claimed Wolves and Marseille have ‘entered the race’ even though Galatasaray have made the 25-year-old a priority. “We are in talks with Galatasaray, they have made an offer and want Ahmed,” he said. “The transfer is a possibility, Galatasaray are a big club and will compete in the Champions League next season. “Musa has offers from other clubs but he’s keen on playing for Galatasaray. “We are currently working on a loan deal with an option to buy. He’ll make a decision soon. I think we can say there’s a 50% chance of Musa joining the club,” Musa’s agent William D’avila revealed. Musa hit the global headlines when he scored twice in the Super Eagles’ win over Iceland last week.
However, he has struggled to have an impact at Leicester and ended last season on loan to CSKA Moscow.

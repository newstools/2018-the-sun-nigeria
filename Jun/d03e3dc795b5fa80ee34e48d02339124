NAN The Kaduna State Muslim Pilgrims Welfare Board, on Thursday, said it had fixed Friday, June 29, as the final date for payment of Hajj fares by intending pilgrims for this year’s hajj from the state. The board’s Public Relations Officer, Yunusa  Abdullahi, told journalists in Kaduna that the fixing the deadline became necessary in order to meet the June 30 deadline fixed by the National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON). He warned that defaulters would forfeit their chance to make the trip as NAHCON had also fixed deadline for remittance of the fares to be the same June 30, 2018. “The approved hajj fare for the pilgrims from the state is N1, 490,614.05, less than the 2017 fare by N44, 889.95. “Last year pilgrims in the state paid N1, 535.505.” he said.

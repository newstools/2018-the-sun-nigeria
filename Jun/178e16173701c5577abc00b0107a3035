Nigeria captain John Obi Mikel has more or less accepted to play in a more withdrawn role should he be asked to play there in Nigeria’s game against Iceland today. The midfielder and the Nigeria coach Gernot Rohr were both criticized for the former playing as a No 10 in the loss to Croatia and while Mikel has said he still feels comfortable playing higher up the pitch, he would have no problems playing a more defensive role. “Mikel has been very professional and has accepted to push back to a more withdrawn role and play as a screen for the defence against Iceland in a match we have to win,” SCORENigeria quoted a team official as saying.

Reuters/NAN The U. S. will send experts from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to Ethiopia to investigate a bomb blast that took place during a rally on Saturday, state-affiliated media said on Monday. Fana Broadcasting Corporation quoted Under Secretary of Commerce Gilbert Kaplan as making the remark on Monday during his talks with Ethiopia’s minister of foreign affairs. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed survived the grenade attack on Saturday at a massive rally in support of his push for radical political and economic reforms, including a peace deal with regional arch-enemy Eritrea. Authorities said 30 people have now been arrested, up from six from the day before, over alleged involvement in a grenade attack at a rally in the Ethiopian capital that killed two people and left more than 150 people wounded, police said on Sunday. “Rhe number of suspects in custody for involvement in the attack in Meskel Square has now reached 30,” Zeinu Jemal, head of the Federal Police Commission, told state-owned Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation. Zeinu did not give further details. A second person has died after the deadly attack .

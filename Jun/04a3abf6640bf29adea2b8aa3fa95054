While soliciting for the support of the people to enable him and his management team succeed, the council boss promised to operate a transparent, honest and open door administration. “I want to call on you all to be prudent, transparent and accountable in the discharge of your duties in order to justify the confidence of your people that have elected you. “Transparency and accountability should be your watch words because corruption and injustice, among others ills, have affected our lives and the socio-economic development of the country negatively. “Both the Executive and the Legislature need to work together as a team for the progress and development of this area,” he said. Kurki also assured the people of his readiness to initiate good policies and programmes that have direct bearing on their lives. He commended Gov.

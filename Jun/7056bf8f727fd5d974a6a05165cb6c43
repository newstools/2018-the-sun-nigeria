With the 2018 FIFA World Cup only a few days away, MultiChoice Nigeria has announced an extension of its Call Centre operating hours from 8am till midnight daily, until the 16 July, 2018. This extension will allow customers on its DStv and GOtv platforms have access to quality service as they enjoy every moment of the tournament. Previously operating daily from 8am to 9pm, the three-hour extension will give customers more time to contact customer care representatives on varying issues such as subscription payment, reconnection and content scheduling. Speaking on the recent development, Managing Director, MultiChoice Nigeria, Mr. John Ugbe said the extension is for customers to have access to quality service as they watch the World Cup on DStv and GOtv. “By increasing our operational hours, we have improved our service delivery in a significant way. Now our customers have more time to reach us when they encounter any hitches with our services and be assured of prompt resolution. “We are continually shaping our business to respond to our customers’ needs and this includes service efficiency. Great customer service is a key component of our strategy to provide end-to-end solutions, delivery and support to our customers,” he said.

Tony John, Port Harcourt Former vice president, Atiku Abubakar, has declared Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, the best performing governor in the country. He said Wike will continue to win the award because of his state-wide delivery of relevant projects.
Atiku said this yesterday, when he commissioned 11 roads under the Isiokpo internal roads phase one, constructed by Wike’s administration in Ikwerre Local Government Area of the state. The former vice president said Wike has won the ‘Governor of the Year Award’ consecutively, since  2016, because he has been executing projects to improve the lives of the people. He said: “Since May, this year, as part of the third anniversary of Wike’s administration, one project is commissioned each day. The Isiokpo internal roads form part of the projects. “No wonder Wike keeps winning the Best Governor of the Year, consecutively, since 2016. No governor has achieved that record. It will be very difficult to beat the record. “I am extremely proud of Wike’s achievements, and we are proud of his leadership.”
Atiku said he appreciates the quality of work done, so far, by Wike, because he (Atiku) lived in Port Harcourt and understands the profound nature of the projects delivered. In his remarks, Wike said the second phase of Isiokpo internal roads would be completed before the end of this year. The governor also announced that the Ibaa-Isiokpo Road will be completed and commissioned by the end of the year.

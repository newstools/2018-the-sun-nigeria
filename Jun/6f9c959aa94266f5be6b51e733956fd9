The Head Coach of the men’s senior National team Alex Nwora has released his final team list for the 2019 FIBA World Cup qualifiers taking centre stage this weekend. The 12-man list announced at the team’s last training session on Thursday will be headlined by Sinchuan Blue Whales player and captain, Ike Diogu. Others are Omoerah Keith Sado (Baerum Basket, Norway), Braxton Ogbueze Jai (Charlotte University, USA), Nwora Jordan (University of Louisville, USA) Agada Caleb Apochi (Prat, Spain) and Okosun Augustine Obehioye (Sameji Dominican Republic). Mehinti Tosin Idowu (Lavrio, Greece) and Moses Kingsley (Antwerp Giants, Belgium) were also selected and are all in line to make their first competitive debut for Nigeria. Others are Uzoh Benjamin (CB Caballero De Culican, Mexico), Mbamalu Bryant (CD Vildivia, Chile), Zanna Talib (Ironi Nes-Zion’s, Italy) and Emenago Obinna Clinton (Rouen Basket, France). Apart from being the first time the national team will be playing its world cup qualifiers at home, the ‘Nworas’ are also in line to make history as the first family in Nigeria to have the father and son in the national team at the same time. Speaking on their readiness, Nwora said the team is as ready as they can be as they look forward to a great match against Uganda tomorrow. “It’s going to be a good test for us tomorrow but hopefully we will be victorious. “We played them before. The last time we played them, they gave us a lot of problem. Now, they have newer players who did not play in the second window,” Nwora concluded.

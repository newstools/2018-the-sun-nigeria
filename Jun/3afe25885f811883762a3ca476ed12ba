Paul Osuyi, Asaba Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State has implored members of the Super Eagles to play with confidence in the 2018 FIFA World Cup, which commences today. Okowa gave the charge shortly after inspecting the on-going rehabilitation work at Asaba Stadium in preparation for the hosting of the Senior Africa Athletic Championship (SAAC) in August this year.
“For our children and the national team for the World Cup, I wish them well, they must play with confidence and realise that they stand in and carry the symbol of the Nigerian nation. “As such, they must go all out and give their best. It is our hope that they do very well.
As Nigerians, all we need to do is to pray for the team rather than complain,” the governor said.

Ahmed Musa said Super Eagles must target six points, if they are to qualify from the group of death at the World Cup, but he may not play too big a role to start with. The Leicester City winger, who is joined in the Super Eagles squad by his City teammates, Wilfred Ndidi and Kelechi Iheanacho, believed Nigeria will top a group that also included Argentina, Croatia and Iceland, but they must target wins over the latter two before facing Argentina in a group decider to achieve their goal. “‘We need a maximum,” he said. “I think we need six points. The plan is to win the first two games.”
However, Super Eagles’ Coach, Gernot Rohr was worried about Musa’s stamina ahead of his side’s opener against Croatia on Saturday. The former Bayern Munich defender had expressed his concerns that the Ramadan fasting, which ends tomorrow, will affect his performance in the game with the Croats. “For the first game, it will not be easy to put it away,” said Rohr to the German Press Agency.
”The energy loss is difficult to balance in such a short time. We’ll probably lug it into the first game.”
During Ramadan, Muslims abstain from eating any food and drinking from sunrise to sunset; travellers can be exempted from fasting, but they should make up for lost fast days later.

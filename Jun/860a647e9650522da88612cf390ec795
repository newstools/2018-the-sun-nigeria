Reuters/NAN International rating agency, Moody’s, on Tuesday said uncertainty around land and mining reforms might hinder South Africa’s growth. Moody’s Analyst and Senior Credit Officer, Lucie Villa, said in a research report in Johannesburg that the reforms had remained a concern for investors. Villa said that weak business confidence could limit the country’s economic growth prospects. “Uncertainty over how this (land reform) will be achieved continues to limit near-term investment. “(It) could ultimately lead to a more pronounced fall in investment should the final terms of land reform be particularly onerous to businesses,” Villa said.

Everton director of football Marcel Brands has revealed that he is a massive fan of Everton youngster Ademola Lookman and even tried to sign him for PSV Eindhoven last year. The attacker was sent out on loan to RB Leipzig in the Bundesliga last year by former manager Sam Allardyce, much to the dismay of Evertonians who believe that he could have shone for Everton, but Brands has revealed that he will very much be part of the first team next season. “I can be clear in that because I know the player very well. “He was on my list at PSV (to sign). He is a very talented young player and I think he has to be moved up next year (to the first team squad).”

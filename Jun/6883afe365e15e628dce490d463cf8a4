Rose Ejembi, Makurdi Speaker, Benue State House of Assembly, Terkimbi Ikyange, has applauded the Federal Government for granting financial autonomy to State Houses of Assembly, saying the gesture would deepen democracy and enhance good governance across the country. Ikyange gave the commendation on Saturday while reacting to the presidential assent to the Constitution Amendment for the alteration bill which grants financial autonomy to all the State Houses of Assembly. In a statement signed by his Press Secretary, Bem Abunde, the Speaker noted that granting financial independence to state legislative houses will not only lead to the growth and development of the legislature but will also bring about effective oversight which will translate to good governance. The Speaker expressed the assurance that the development would enable state parliaments to have more funds to improve the capacity of their legislators and staff through regular trainings, seminars and workshops. He maintained that the decision of the Federal Government to grant autonomy to State Houses of Assembly is timely especially as it came at a time the Benue State House of Assembly passed the Benue State House of Assembly Service Commission bill, which aims at granting administrative autonomy to the assembly. He commended Governor Samuel Ortom and other state governors for the tremendous support they had accorded their state legislatures.

…As Ohanaeze inaugurates new Lagos Exco Gilbert Ekezie and Brown Chimezie The Chairman of South and Middle Belt Forum, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, has stated that Nigeria will cease to exist if restructuring is not carried out by the present administration. 
He stated this yesterday during the official inauguration of newly elected executives of Ohanaeze Ndigbo in Lagos State. The event attended by dignitaries like Commodore Ebitu Ukiwe, who was chairman on the occasion, former military administrator of Lagos State, Rear Admiral Ndubisi Kanu, former Governor of Ondo State Dr Olusegun Mimiko, former Governor of Anambra State, Chief Chukwuemeka Ezeife, former Minister of Information, Dr Walter Ofonagoro, Eze Ndigbo Lagos, Hyacaint Ohazulike, Prince Adedeji Dosunmu, Chief Guy Ikoku and others. Adebanjo said anything short of the restructuring of the country is worthless, stressing that Nigeria is not moving ahead with the present 1999 constitution written by the military without the contributions of Nigerians. He commended Ndigbo for their useful contributions and efforts to unite themselves and the country, and noted that the country has suffered for a long time due to a non-inclusive constitution and called on Nigerians not to vote for anyone that is not in support of restructuring of the country. “As we are talking about the 2019 election, we should be mindful that we are expected to vote those who are ready to restructure the country. That is our stand as leaders of South and Middle Belt Forum. There is no going back and we have no regret.”

Aidoghie Paulinus, Abuja A former Secretary to the Enugu State Government, Chief Onyemauche Nnamani, has said he was in the All Progressives Congress (APC) vice chairmanship race to boost President Muhammadu Buhari’s chances of winning the 2019 presidential election in the South East. Speaking with Daily Sun at the Tafawa Balewa House, Abuja, Nnamani said he was at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to confer with the leader of the APC in Enugu State, Mr. Geoffrey Onyeama, on convention issues. “I am going for the office of the national vice chairman of the Southeast who also doubles as the chairman of the zone. “The party needs to be revived and the infamous three percent, four percent results at the last presidential election will automatically come to an end. “I will make the party more popular by doing the right thing. First and foremost, we have to bring the party closer to the people through town hall meetings to encourage rapport with the press, get the people closer and more importantly, publicise activities of the government,” Nnamani said. Nnamani further commended President Muhammadu Buhari for the infrastructural development of the southeast. He said that the south east had never had it so good for the past 30 years, bemoaning that the developmental strides of the president in the Southeast had been silent. “So, the party needs to be popular; it needs to be cohesive, it needs to increase the membership and we need to prepare for the next election so that the Southeast states will become part of the mainstream of Nigerian politics,” Nnamani added.

•As Omeruo aims high Super Eagles captain, John Obi Mikel has expressed his readiness for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia.
The showpiece starts on July 14, with the Super Eagles kicking off their campaign two days later against Croatia in Kaliningrad. And having made his debut at the 2014 edition in Brazil, the Tianjin Teda midfielder, leading the Super Eagles to Russia this time around, cannot wait to have another taste of it. Mikel took to Twitter to share a video of him sweating it out on a treadmill, and captioned it: “Running to Russia like…. Ready for action at World Cup 2018.”
After their opening Group D game against the Fiery Ones, Gernot Rohr’s men trade tackles with Iceland and Argentina. The team was currently finalising preparation at its Aviva Resort camp in Austria and was expected to arrive at their World Cup base camp in Essentuki today. Meanwhile, Chelsea defender, Kenneth Omeruo has revealed that Nigeria can win the 2018 World Cup because the players will work their socks off during the tournament in Russia. Omeruo joined a select group of Nigerian players to have represented the country in the FIFA U17 and U20 World Cups, Confederations Cup and World Cup when he went the distance against Iran in Brazil 2014.
‘’Yes, we can win the World Cup. I think we have never gone past the round of sixteen, this time we are not going to say let us go to the round of sixteen,’’ Omeruo told OMASPORTSTV‏. ‘’We will be working hard, taking every game as it comes and hopefully our hard work will see us through to the final or to do something that no African country has done.’’ The former Golden Eaglets and Flying Eagles star added that he prefered playing in the World Cup to the Champions League. Omeruo will compete with Leon Balogun, William Troost-Ekong, Chidozie Awaziem, Brian Idowu and John Ogu for the central defensive positions at the World Cup.

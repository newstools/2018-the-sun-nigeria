Former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, has met with former President Goodluck Jonathan in his country home in Otuoke, Bayelsa State. The duo met yesterday. At the meeting, Atiku recalled Jonathan’s exemplary decision to hand over the reins of power without qualms and observed that that singular historic decision set him apart as a democrat of unimpeachable credentials. He also reflected on Jonathan’s action which doused tension in the country at that time and noted that the situation in Nigeria may have been different if he (Jonathan) did not voluntarily relinquish power. “I want to say without equivocation that history will be very kind to you. As the democrat that I have always been, I want to say you have truly excelled! If you did not excel as a democrat par excellence, I wonder what the situation in Nigeria would be today,” Abubakar said.
In his response, Jonathan commended Atiku for appointing former governor of Ogun State, Gbenga Daniel, as director general of his Presidential Campaign Organisation.
He noted that Daniel’s choice as director general was spot on, considering that as DG of his own (Jonathan’s) campaign in the South West, Daniel’s hard work paid off and was capped with huge electoral success in the zone. Jonathan also said his relationship with Atiku dates back to more than 16 years ago when he was deputy governor of Bayelsa State during which time the Waziri Adamawa showed him friendship and support. On his part, Daniel paid tribute to Jonathan as the most educated president Nigeria has ever had, who made it through the ranks as deputy governor to becoming vice president and subsequently, president of Nigeria.

• Says his best’ll play Nigeria Croatia Coach, Zlatko Dalić expects Nigeria to be a threat on the counter attack when they face off with the three-time African champions in their World Cup opener at Kaliningrad Stadium, Kaliningrad on June 16, 2018. If the Super Eagles friendlies and training sessions are anything to go by, Arsenal starlet, Alex Iwobi, Chelsea’s Victor Moses and former Watford star, Odion Ighalo are the players manager Gernot Rohr had chosen to turn defense into attack on Saturday.
Speaking to reporters before the squad departed Zagreb’s Franjo Tuđman Airport manager Zlatko Dalić, refused to provide clues about his starting lineup against Nigeria, saying only the best players would be fielded. Dalić has opined that Nigeria have the same playing style as West Africans Senegal, whom they beat in their last pre-World Cup friendly. ‘’It was a clean game, and that is what will be our game with Nigeria. They have firm formation and then open up in counter attacks with three fast players,’’ Dalic was quoted as saying by Sportske Novosti. ‘’We have to know what is waiting us and this was a good test for that. But, I say that we have to be better in some elements of the game.’’
“We have played four games, we have tried a lot, now we have to choose the best against Nigeria in five days. The match with Nigeria is the first and most important one,” said Dalic. “I will give the opportunity to the best, neither young nor old, the best, Senegal has shown us all, we have to fix some things. There is no reason to fear.”

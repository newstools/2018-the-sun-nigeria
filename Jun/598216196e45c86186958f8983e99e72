Some of football’s biggest names have been secured by SuperSport to underpin this year’s broadcast of the 2018 FIFA World Cup on DStv and GOtv. Yaya Touré, one of the most celebrated African players of the past decade, will be joined by straight-talking Jay-Jay Okocha, Dwight Yorke (one half of the deadly duo which spearheaded Manchester United’s charge to a historical treble in 1999) plus former Manchester United and Everton fullback, Phil Neville and Italian maestro Gianfranco Zola, one of Chelsea’s greatest players. Other African guests doing SuperSport duty include, Samson Siasia, Shaun Bartlett, Gavin Hunt, Andre Arendse and Benni McCarthy. The presenters will be made up of the experienced foursome of Robert Marawa, Carol Tshabalala, Neil Andrews and Andy Townsend. DStv customers can catch the action live on SS3, SS13 and SS14, while GOtv customers on SS Select 1 and SS Select 4.

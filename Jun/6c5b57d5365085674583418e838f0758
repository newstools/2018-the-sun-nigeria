Tony John, Port Harcourt Rivers State Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Felix Obuah, has called on the Super Eagles to launch aggressive attack against Argentina in their today’s (Tuesday) encounter, if they hope to make it to the next stage, in the ongoing World Cup in Russia. Obuah, who spoke yesterday, through his media aide, Jerry Needam, charged the Eagles and their technical crew to adopt the same approach used when they walloped Argentina 4-1 during a recent international friendly. The soccer-loving State PDP boss said he was optimistic that, if they put their acts together, they could re-enact the superlative performance, which led to the 4-1 drubbing of Argentina only a few months ago. The PDP chairman, who is also the President and Sole sponsor of Go-Round Football Club (FC) of Omoku charged the Eagles to relive what he called the ‘resilience, doggedness and grit’ for which they are known; urging them to “remain focused knowing that Nigerians in their millions are praying for their success”. Obuah, who is also the Sole Administrator of Rivers State Waste Management Agency (RIWAMA) said Nigerians back home are eagerly waiting for the explosive encounter for another round of celebration, and urged the boys not to disappoint them. “Super Eagles enjoy comparative advantage and should approach Argentina with the spirit of a giant killer, still relishing their triumph over a highly-rated Iceland. Though, not under-rating Argentina, Eagles should know they are meeting a severely wounded and demoralized Argentine side, who has been troubled by Croatia. “So, placed side by side, Super Eagles are definitely in a better frame of mind and that element of psychology, if exploited, would see them smiling at the end of the day”, he posited.

NAN Reports say that two Israeli missiles fired by Israel have landed near Damascus International Airport late Monday. The state-run Syrian media reported that the missiles hit an arms depot belonging to the Lebanese Shiite Movement Hezbollah. According to the media, the head of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, Rami Rahman, confirmed early Tuesday. Syrian opposition sources said the midnight attack targeted an Iranian cargo plane which was landing at Damascus International Airport. There was no immediate word on casualties. Damascus residents told dpa they had heard several loud blasts shortly after midnight coming from near the airport. Israel has said that it will not tolerate Iran, a key ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, seeking to establish permanent military bases in Syria. Syrian state-run news agency SANA, which routinely accuses Israel of helping rebels, said the strikes came as Syrian forces made advances against rebels in the southern province of Daraa. Israel usually does not comment on the strikes it is alleged to have carried out in Syria. Syrian and Iranian military facilities in the war-torn country have been hit several times since April. Iran has vowed retaliation for one alleged Israeli strike on April 30 that killed a number of Iranian personnel. Iran and their Hezbollah-backed movement have been fighting alongside Syrian government forces since the conflict started in 2011.

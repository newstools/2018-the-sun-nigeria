Eighteen years after Nigeria hosted the All African Senior Badminton Championships, the country has been given another opportunity to play host to the rest of Africa from 22nd to 28th of April 2019. President of the Badminton Federation of Nigeria (BFN), Barrister Francis Orbih, expressed his gratitude to the Badminton Confederation of Africa (BCA) for granting Nigeria the hosting right. He also thanked the Executive Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike for accepting to host the championship. The Barr Orbih led BFN submitted a bid to host the event at the BCA Annual General Meeting (AGM), which held in Thailand earlier this year.

The new excise duty for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, earlier approved by President Muhammadu Buhari, will take effect from today, the Federal Government has said. In March, Minister of Finance, Mrs Kemi Adeosun, announced that the president had granted a grace period of 90 days; to manufacturers of the products. Adeosun said the new excise duty rates would spread over a three-year period from 2018 to 2020, in order to moderate the impact on prices of the products. Adeosun said upward review of the excise duty rates for alcoholic beverages and tobacco is to raise government’s fiscal revenue. She said it would also reduce the health hazards associated with tobacco-related diseases and alcohol abuse.
Adeosun said the new duty rate on tobacco is a combination of the existing ad-valorem base rate and specific rate while the ad-valorem rate was replaced with a specific rate for alcoholic beverages. She said under the new rates for tobacco, in addition to the 20 per cent ad-valorem rate, each stick of cigarette will attract one naira specific rate per stick; that is N20 per pack of 20 sticks in 2018. She said that in 2019, tobacco will attract two naira specific rate per stick or N40 per pack of 20 sticks. The minister said that by 2020, tobacco would begin to attract N2.90 kobo specific rate per stick or N58 per pack of 20 sticks. Adeosun explained that Nigeria’s cumulative specific excise duty rate for tobacco is 23.2 per cent of the price of the most sold brand. This is against 38.14 per cent in Algeria, 36.52 per cent in South Africa and 30 per cent in Gambia. She said also that the new specific excise duty rate for alcoholic beverages cut across beer and stout, wines and spirits from 2018 to 2020. Under the new regime, beer and stout will attract 0.30k per centilitre (Cl) in 2018 and 0.35k per Cl each in 2019 and 2020. Wines will attract N1.25k per Cl in 2018 and N1.50k per Cl each in 2019 and 2020, while N1.50k per Cl was approved for spirits in 2018, N1.75k per Cl in 2019 and N2 per Cl in 2020. Director General of the Consumer Protection Council (CPC), Babatunde Irukera, said the decision to increase excise duty on these commodities is consistent with prevailing global practices. Irukera said he is convinced government’s approach will foster consumer confidence, provide regulatory clarity and prioritise safety, to reinforce the mandate of the council.
Also, Deputy Executive Director, Environmental Rights Action of Earth Nigeria, Akinbode Oluwafemi, described the decision to increase excise duty on tobacco as praise-worthy. “We applaud the federal government for making tobacco products priced beyond the reach of our kids and the poor who are, unfortunately, targeted by the tobacco industry through their cheap but lethal products. “Considering the looming tobacco menace in Nigeria, it is necessary to take stringent measures to halt the deliberate marketing of tobacco products to kids,” Oluwafemi said. However, the President, Manufacturers Association of Nigeria, Dr Frank Jacobs, expressed fear that the proposed hike may lead to close of factories and loss of jobs in the country.

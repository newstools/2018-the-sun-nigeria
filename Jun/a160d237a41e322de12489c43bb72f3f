Financial Express Happy Father’s Day 2018 Wishes: The role of a father in a child’s life is often considered secondary to that of a mother but all of us know that fathers are as much a significant figure in the development and emotional well being of a child. So, it is only fitting to dedicate a day to honour this beautiful paternal bond and fatherhood. Father’s Day falls on Sunday, June 17 this year. It is celebrated by Americans on third Sunday of June to celebrate fatherhood, paternal bonds and the contribution of fathers in lives of their children. However, this day gained momentum and is now widely celebrated across the world in different countries like the UK, France, India, Japan, China, the Philippines and South Africa.

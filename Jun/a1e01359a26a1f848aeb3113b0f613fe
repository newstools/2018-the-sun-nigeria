Tony John, Port Harcourt Rivers State PDP chairman Felix Obuah says Super Eagles should launch an aggressive attack against Argentina in their Tuesday match if they hope to make it to the next round of the World Cup Obuah, who spoke Monday through his media aide, Jerry Needam, charged the national team and their technical crew to adopt the same approach used when they walloped Argentina 4-1 during a recent international friendly. The soccer-loving State PDP boss said he was optimistic that if the Eagles pull their act together, they could re-enact the superlative performance, which led to the 4-1 drubbing of Argentina only a few months ago.f The PDP chairman, who is also the President and Sole sponsor of Go-Round Football Club (FC) of Omoku, charged the Eagles to relive what he called the ‘resilience, doggedness and grit’ for which they are known; urging them to “remain focused knowing that Nigerians in their millions are praying for their success”. Obuah, who is also the Sole Administrator of Rivers State Waste Management Agency (RIWAMA), said Nigerians back home are eagerly waiting for the explosive encounter for another round of celebration, u and urged the team not to disappoint the country. “Super Eagles enjoy comparative advantage and should approach Argentina with the spirit of a giant killer, still relishing their triumph over a highly-rated Iceland. Though, not under-rating Argentina, Eagles should know they are meeting a severely wounded and demoralized Argentine side, who has been troubled by Croatia. “So, placed side by side, Super Eagles are definitely in a better frame of mind and that element of psychology, if exploited, would see them smiling at the end of the day,” Obuah stated.

SkySports Ronda Rousey has been suspended for 30 days following her fierce attack on Kurt Angle and Raw women’s champion Alexa Bliss. Bliss held a celebratory ceremony in the ring to mark the fact she won the Raw title at Money In The Bank on Sunday night, with Kurt Angle on hand to congratulate her and inform her Nia Jax will be invoking her rematch clause at Extreme Rules. The insults came thick and fast from Bliss to Rousey, but she appeared to be safe from any potential attacks due to the presence of Angle between the competitors. It was all too much to take for Rousey, who had been on the verge of beating Jax herself before Bliss’ interference and briefcase cash-in. She first attacked Bliss, and when Angle attempted to intervene, he too was on the receiving end of several body strikes and briefcase shots from the former UFC champion. The assault continued, with Bliss being put through a table and several referees also feeling the physical wrath of Rousey, acts for which she will now serve a 30-day suspension.

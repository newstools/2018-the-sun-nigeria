Leader of the Caucus of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abia, Chief Sam Nkire, has predicted that the party may lose the governorship election in the state if it does not field a candidate of Ukwa-Ngwa extraction. In a statement he personally signed, yesterday, Nkire said the reason no serious aspirant from the southern part of the country is contesting the presidency today is because it was generally agreed that the North must complete its turn. Nkire said the only way to defeat the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) administration in Abia state is to choose a popular candidate from Ukwa-Ngwa. He added that any political party who chooses its candidate from outside Ukwa-Ngwa will fail in 2019. He said the Ukwa-Ngwa people, just as the people of northern Nigeria would close ranks once their ‘turn’ is threatened and, therefore, further appealed to the people of Old Bende not to ignore the sentiments of the Ukwa-Ngwa people of Abia state. Nkire was also of the opinion that anybody in Abia APC who says he or she does not see the realities on ground is not being sincere and, therefore, does not mean well for the party in the 2019 general election. He urged the people of Old Bende to give Ukwa-Ngwa people a little more time to conclude the process of selecting a credible and popular candidate capable of defeating the PDP in Abia state.

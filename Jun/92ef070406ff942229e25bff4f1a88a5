Nigeria will face Argentina in today by 7pm to either move to the round of 16 or be eliminated . This would be the fifth time Nigeria will be facing Argentina in the World cup Group Stage. The Eagles were confronted with Argentina in 1994,2002, 2010 and 2014 an unluckily lost all the matches,but with recent defeat of Argentina in a friendly in Russia, many believe it is possible for the Eagles to defeat Argentina. Super eagle fans have taken twitter to pray, predict and show support @FIFAWorldCupNGA

I’m a Barca and Messi fan but I won’t be supporting him against Nigeria. Country blood is thicker than Club Blood.

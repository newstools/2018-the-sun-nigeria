‘’I’m particularly pleased that he took the time to look beyond our current league status and understand who we are as a club before choosing us ahead of current Premier League and Bundesliga clubs.” Manager Gary Rowett added: ‘’We’re really excited to have got the deal over the line for Etebo. I’m looking forward to seeing him in a Stoke City shirt as I’m sure our supporters are too.’’ The 22-year-old was a second half substitute in Nigeria’s 2-1 loss to England in a pre-World Cup friendly staged at Wembley on June 2.

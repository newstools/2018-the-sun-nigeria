With young Francis Uzoho confirmed as the first choice in the Super Eagles line up, Nigerians would be shocked to learn that Enyimba International of Aba shot stopper, Ikechukwu Ezenwa is lowly ranked in the pecking order when the World Cup starts on Thursday. Instead, the man many Nigerians love to hate, South Africa’s Chippa United goalkeeper, Daniel Akpeyi will most likely deputise for the Deportivo de La Coruna youngster in the opening game against Croatia. Akpeyi has not evoke confidence in the minds of Nigerians in the matches he played on the absence of Carl Ikeme but Ezenwa instilled some confidence in the matches against Cameroun prior to qualification for the World Cup. He was also outstanding in the CHAN, where the home-based lost in the final to the hosts, Morocco. With Uzoho almost already confirmed as the first choice goalkeeper, Akpeyi will automatically assist him and in the eventuality that Uzoho is unavailable to play, the Chippa United ‘keeper will get the nod.

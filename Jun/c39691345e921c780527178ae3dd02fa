Fred Ezeh, Abuja The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has raised the alarm that Federal Government has allegedly directed police, army and other security agencies to recruit some former Boko Haram terrorists that were recently de-radicalised. In expression of its dissatisfaction, the CAN asked the Federal Government should withdraw the directive because of its potency to compromise Nigeriaâ€™s security system. Its President, Dr. Samson Ayokunle Olasupo, in a statement by his media aide, Pastor Bayo Oladeji, expressed worry that Nigerian security system was gradually being infiltrated by people of questionable characters. Meanwhile, the Association has asked Federal Government to prevail on Adamawa State Government, to reverse the death sentence passed on five Christian youths alleged to have killed a Fulani herdsman. The Association made reference to recent media report that indicated that Justice Abdul-Azeez Waziri of a High Court in Adamawa State, sentenced Alex Amos, Alheri Phanuel, Holy Boniface, Jerry Gideon and Jari Sabagi to death for culpable homicide. The convicts were said to have allegedly, on June 1, 2017, at Kadamun village in Demsa Local Government Area conspired and attacked three Fulani herdsmen, killing one of them, Adamu Buba, whose body was later found in a nearby river. The convicts were also alleged to have maimed several cows in course of the confrontation. The Association insisted that it does not support jungle justice or any criminality. But was unhappy that hundreds of Christians in Kaduna, Benue, Taraba, Plateau states, are killed on daily basis, with neither arrest nor prosecution from the government. It, thus, solicited the intervention of President Muhammadu Buhari, in the death sentence passed on the Christian youths in Adamawa, even as it asked its legal team to carefully study the judgment to avoid miscarriage of justice and recurrence.

Egypt have parted company with head coach Hector Cuper following the nation’s underwhelming World Cup campaign. The Pharaohs, appearing at their first World Cup finals for 28 years, finished bottom of Group A without a single point to their name. A last-gasp 1-0 defeat by Uruguay was followed up by a 3-1 loss to hosts Russia and ended with Monday’s 2-1 defeat by Saudi Arabia. Cuper, 62, would have been out of contract after the tournament, but had been in negotiations with the Egypt Football Association before the tournament started. However, the EFA confirmed in a statement on Tuesday: “We held a meeting after returning from Russia and the entire board decided to say thank you to Cuper and his technical staff. “We appreciate the work from the coach, from reaching the Africa Cup of Nations after three years of absence and taking Egypt to the World Cup after 28 years of absence.” Egypt’s World Cup build-up was dominated by an injury to star player Mohamed Salah.

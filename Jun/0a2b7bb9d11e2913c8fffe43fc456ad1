Job Osazuwa A beauty pageant organisation, Miss Earth Nigeria, has thrown its weight behind the call to achieve a greener environment in the country. At a press conference in Lagos, recently, to raise awareness on emerging environmental issues, especially on marine pollution and global warming, National Director of the organisation, Ibinabo Fiberesima, said it is everyone’s responsibility to have a safe environment to live in. While advocating total eradication of plastic bottles and encouraged Nigerians to have their own reusable water bottle, she also advised people at homes and offices to separate bottles, plastics, papers waste in order to encourage recycling. To further create more awareness on the benefits of green environment through environmental conservation and sustainable ecosystem, Fiberesima announced that her organisation would in October hold Miss Earth Nigeria Environment Award (MENEA). “MENEA is to encourage a sustainable pro-active environment in Nigeria. It is to celebrate those who are already environmental friendly and have gone green; to also inspire others to go green, because the world is green. “The award seeks to acknowledge states, corporations and individuals in Nigeria that have achieved significant environmental footprints and have support for waste management, parks, green zones, renewable sources of energy, tourism, ecological management and wild preservation.”

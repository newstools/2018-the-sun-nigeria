Eyewitness Kit Harington and Rose Leslie are officially husband and wife after tying the knot at the actress’ childhood home, Wardhill Castle in Aberdeenshire. The ‘Game of Thrones’ stars – who played lovers Jon Snow and Ygritte in HBO fantasy series – tied the knot in front of friends and family at Rayne Church in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, on Saturday. The newlyweds, both 31, were showered in confetti as they exited the church and jumped into a Land Rover Defender with “just married” signs and a pair of tins cans tied to the back. Guests including their castmates, Peter Dinklage, Maisie Williams, Sophie Turner and Emilia Clarke, gathered outside the church to see the pair drive off to Wardhill Castle, which is owned by the bride’s father Sebastian Leslie – who with his daughter is a descendant of Charles II – to continue the celebrations. Leslie stunned in a traditional flowing ivory dress with a summery flower crown and a long veil. The bride was given away by her father, who donned a Scottish tartan kilt, and was beaming as the pair walked towards the church arm-in-arm. Speaking outside of the stunning grounds of the magnificent 12th-century castle – which beds 16 people in the main building – whilst helping with last minute preparations this afternoon, Sebastian said he was “thrilled” for the couple. He told press: “We are absolutely thrilled for Kit and Rose to be marrying today.” Mumford & Sons, whose frontman Marcus Mumford was seen hobbling on crutches as he arrived into Aberdeen airport hours ago with his bandmates, are believed to be performing for the couple this evening. The pair confirmed their engagement by posting an announcement in the Forthcoming Marriages section of The Times newspaper. It read: “The engagement is announced between Kit, younger son of David and Deborah Harington of Worcestershire, and Rose, middle daughter of Sebastian and Candy Leslie of Aberdeenshire.”

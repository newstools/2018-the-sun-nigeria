Romanus Ugwu, Abuja A former governor of Edo State and an aspirant for the position of All Progressives Congress (APC) National Chairmanship, Prof. Osarhiemen Osunbor, on Wednesday, stepped down for Comrade Adams Oshiomhole. Speaking when he visited Oshiomhole’s campaign headquarters in company of his wife, Osunbo hinged his withdrawal from the race on his claim that Oshiomhole has the experience to lead the party to the next level. Osunbor further explained that he earlier joined the race not to fight Oshiomhole as insinuated but to also see how he can contribute his quota to the growth of the party. Said he, “I came here specially in solidarity with my wife and I want to say that you have the experience and all it takes to lead APC,” he said, adding: “I want to state here that I never joined the race for chairmanship to fight you, never. “I appreciate the relationship which has existed between your family and mine over the years. I do not want this to destroy our relationship. I am happy the President is with you and majority of our party leaders are with you and I have great respect for Mr. President. “I am stepping down for you and to support you because you are my brother, my friend and a man that is well respected across the country. “I believe that Edo State is lucky to have this situation and I can tell you that by Saturday we may go for that election unopposed so that we will not go and start counting votes that will take us for too long. I congratulate you and I will work to ensure you succeed,” he said. Reacting, Oshiomhole commended him for the visit, noting that he intend to work with leaders like Osunbor to move the party forward. “I think we have a huge challenge ahead after the convention and we will need people like Osunbor to assist. I am happy you decided to withdraw because some how I was worried due to the relationship we have enjoyed over the years,” he quipped.

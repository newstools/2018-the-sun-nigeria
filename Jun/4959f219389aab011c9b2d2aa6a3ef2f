NAN The World Trade Organisation (WTO) has warned that the trade conflict between the US and other countries could negatively impact on global economy, if it intensifies. WTO Director-General, Roberto Azevedo, warned on Wednesday, that there were indications that this was already happening. When asked if there was a risk for the global economy, Azevedo told Business Daily Media: “Absolutely. “If the trade dispute escalates, there is the risk of a global downturn, and we are already seeing signs that this downward process has already started.” He said that it was crucial to maintain dialogue to avoid escalation.

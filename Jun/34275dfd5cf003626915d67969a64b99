Argentina forward, Lionel Messi has said that the Super Eagles of Nigeria are one of the most compact African teams and always difficult to predict. Messi will be hoping to end his World Cup journey with a trophy, having come close in 2014, where the team narrowly lost 1-0 to Germany in the final. Argentina are expected to face Nigeria in their last Group match, something the Barcelona forward pointed out that Nigeria are always strong and difficult to play with. “We don’t know so much about Nigeria but the African teams are normally compact, tough and strong. So it will be no walkover.”

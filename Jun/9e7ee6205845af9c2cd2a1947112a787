Nigeria’s Super Eagles recorded her first win in the ongoing Russia 2018 World Cup in Volgograd after  Ahmed Musa scored a brace over Iceland. Nigeria found themselves in desperate need of a victory over Iceland if they were to avoid an early World Cup exit. The Super Eagles were incredibly disappointing in their opening 2-0 defeat to Croatia and come up against an Iceland side who showed remarkable spirit in holding Argentina to a 1-1 draw. If Iceland were to win, on Friday, Argentina would have found themselves in severe trouble following their 3-0 loss to Croatia on Thursday night.

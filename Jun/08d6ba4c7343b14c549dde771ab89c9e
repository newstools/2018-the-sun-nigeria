The Local Organising Committee (LOC) called on journalists and media houses willing to cover the Africa’s elite table tennis tournament holding on August 8 to 12, 2018 to register before the July 20 deadline. Only accredited journalists and media houses will have access to the players and media tribune during the tournament. Also, accredited journalists and media houses are expected to book their interviews with some of the top players in advance with the LOC during the tournament. The $46,000 prize money five-day championship holds at the Molade Okoya-Thomas Hall of Teslim Balogun Stadium in Lagos.

The Local Organising Committee (LOC) said that this year’s tournament would witness large turnout of top players from Africa, Asia and Europe just as defending champions – Egypt’s Omar Assar and Dina Meshref have promised to come and defend their titles. Six events have been listed by ITTF and they are singles (men and women); doubles (men and women) as well as U-21 boys and girls. The deadline for registration of players in singles  is on July 9 while for doubles is July 19, 2018 while 2016 champion – Olah Benedek of Finland has confirmed his return to Lagos this year. Also Nigeria’s super star – Aruna Quadri will be hoping to turn the tide this year after his unceremonious exit in round of 16 in 2017.

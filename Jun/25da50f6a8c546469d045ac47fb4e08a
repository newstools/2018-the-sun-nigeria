NAN The Joint Military Force, on Tuesday, described as false, a report that three soldiers and a suspected pirate died in a shootout at an oil flow station in Bayelsa at the weekend. Major Abdullahi Ibrahim, spokesman for the force – “Operation DELTA SAFE’’ – told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Yenagoa that the Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC’s) Tunu Flow Station, where the alleged attack happened, recorded no such incident. “The report that three soldiers and an armed pirate died at SPDC’s Tunu Flow Station is not true. “I am in touch with the officer in charge of the flow station; there was no such incident at the flow station. “Members of the public should disregard the report; Tunu station was not attacked; the facility is secure,” Ibrahim said. A media report had claimed that there was a shootout at the Tunu Flow Station operated by SPDC in Letugbene Community of Ekeremor LGA of Bayelsa. The report claimed that the shootout occurred during an attempt by suspected armed sea pirates in four boats to invade the Tunu Flow Station where soldiers were stationed.

Former heavyweight champion Tyson Fury has won his long-awaited comeback fight in Manchester, defeating Sefer Seferi across four one-sided rounds. The Albanian fighterâ€™s team pulled him out of the contest before the fifth round could commence, with the 39-year-old having soaked up a number of punches. Fury, who did not appear in prime shape after more than two years away from the ring, toyed with his opponent in the first round but landed a flurry of blows before the bell. Seferi held onto his rival at every opportunity to buy time, but the punches that the Gypsy King landed in the fourth left him on shaky legs, sinking back onto the ropes and unable to face another round. Fury and his promoter Frank Warren are yet to confirm who his next competitive bout will be against.

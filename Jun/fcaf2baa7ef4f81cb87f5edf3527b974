A Benin-based prophet, Tommy Yisa Aika, is demanding N750,000, to pray for Nigeria to win the 2018 World Cup in Russia. The cleric stated that the Super Eagles would be the first African team to lift the trophy. According to Aika, God is interested in the Super Eagles conquering the world at the Russia 2018 World Cup, “but because we have disobeyed God as a result of our nonchalance towards His directive that we should not engage a White man to lead our team we may lose this golden opportunity which may not come to us again for another sixty years.” To appease God, he has volunteered to intervene with his over 60 prayer warriors who are already on standby, to begin prayer sessions “So, that what has been destroyed can be readjusted to grant the Super Eagles divine favour all through the tournament.” He is, however, asking for the sum of N750,000, which according to him, covers some spiritual materials. Aika claims he would also give some to his prayer warriors as honourarium. Gernot Rohr’s men take on Iceland on Friday, needing a win to stay in the tournament, after they were beaten 2-0 by Croatia last Saturday.

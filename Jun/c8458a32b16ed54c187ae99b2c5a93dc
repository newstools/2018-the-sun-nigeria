George Onyejiuwa, Owerri Deputy governor of Imo State and gubernatorial aspirant, Prince Eze Madumere, has said that his most valuable asset is his integrity. He called on Nigerians to vote for leaders with proven transparency and integrity, saying the that lack of personal  integrity is at the root of bad governance and underdevelopment of the country. Prince Madumere who said this, on Wednesday, during an interactive session with newsmen pointed out that personal integrity is a sine qua non for anybody who is aspiring for a leadership position especially in politics and that he has vowed  maintain his personal integrity. He attributed non-performance of some leaders to the abject lack of transparency, personal integrity, discipline, contentment and the mixing up State affairs with family matters forgetting that at end of their tenure they must account for their stewardship. According to him, “Every leader must be able to maintain a distinction between the government and personal venture. It takes integrity, discipline and contentment to exercise restraint and not be consumed by the temptation of the office. “I have not abused my office going against any agreement found within my statutory function. I have never entered into such agreement without keeping to it. “Like I have always said, my integrity is my most valuable asset because I cherish my freedom and the warmth I enjoy with the people even after government. Adding, it is the lack of Integrity and contentment that some leaders are being sent to jail for converting the resources of the people entrusted in their care to personal and family resources”. He, therefore, called on the people of the State to ensure they enquire into the antecedents of any politician who approaches them for votes so as to forestall any regrets.

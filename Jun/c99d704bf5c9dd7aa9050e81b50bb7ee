Omoniyi Salaudeen A former deputy national chairman (South) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Olabode George, has appealed for an amicable resolution of the deepening face-off between President Muhammadu Buhari and ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo. In a statement made available to Sunday Sun, George urged the two statesmen to sheathe their swords in the spirit of comradeship. The appeal is coming on the heels of the recent alarm raised by Obasanjo over an alleged threat to his life. His words: “I have read Chief Olusegun Obasanjo’s statement about the threat to his life with conscionable, natural concern. I have also read the presidency’s rejoinder, which implied that there is nothing sinister in their motives. Chief Olusegun Obasanjo is a man of towering distinction and excellence who ruled this country both as a military head of state and as a civilian president. He is an international figure who is motivated by patriotic fixity. President Muhammadu Buhari is equally a patriot, a gentleman and officer whose totality of vision is about the growth and welfare of our commonwealth. As a military man I know these senior officers very well. I have worked at close quarters with the two of them. I have no doubt about their selfless commitments to our nation. I am appealing to the two personages as a junior officer to sheathe their swords.” Such an open disagreement, Bode noted, was not in line with military tradition. “Naturally, we can disagree, raise our voices, stamp our feet in disapproval, but never in the open. The essence of the esprit de corps is about mutual felicity and respect for each other,” he posited. He also reiterated the need for urgent restructuring of the country, “We insist on the restructuring of the Nigerian Union to ensure democratic balance, equity, and the ingredients of fairness. On these solid points I remain committed,” he declared.

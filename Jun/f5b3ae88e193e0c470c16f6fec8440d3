Ekiti State Governor, Ayodele Fayose, has declared Tuesday, June 12 ,￼2018 a public holiday in honour of the winner of the June 12, 1993 Presidential Election, the late Chief Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola. In a statement issued on Monday in Ado Ekiti, and signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Idowu Adelusi, Governor Fayose said the holiday will not affect those on essential services like doctors working in government hospitals and men of the State Fire Service. “As done last year, I have directed that tomorrow, June 12, 2018 be observed as Public Holiday in Ekiti State. This is to demonstrate our belief in the sanctity of that day as the day the seed of democracy was planted in Nigeria. “It is hoped that in the spirit of June 12 that has now become the bride of even those who scuttled it and benefited from the annulment, free, fair and credible elections will be allowed in the country so that our democracy can be further sustained. “For me, the best honour that can be done to late Chief MKO Abiola and other unsung heroes of the June 12 struggle is for Nigerians to be allowed unrestricted freedom to elect whoever they want as leaders,” he said.

The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), has affirmed it is ready and committed to conducting free, credible and all-inclusive elections in 2019. INEC chairman, Mahmoud Yakubu, gave the assurance at a one-day national consultation with key stakeholders on importance of women in politics organised by Women Advocates Research and Documentation Centre (WARDC) in Benin, yesterday. Represented by the Deputy Director, Gender Division, INEC Headquarters, Mrs Blessing Obidegwu, Yakubu said the commission is ready to collaborate with stakeholders to ensure that barriers which prevent women from actively participating in elections are addressed. He explained that the commission is collaborating with development partners, including the United Nations Women towards achieving the goals. The INEC boss appealed to electorate who are yet to collect their Permanent Votersâ€™ Cards (PVCs) to do so in the ongoing continuous registration exercise in the local government areas.

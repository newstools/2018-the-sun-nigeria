Newly elected chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, yesterday, revealed how he will resolve the crises rocking the party. Speaking after he was sworn in at the Eagles Square, Abuja, Oshiomhole promised to accommodate various views and work with different organs of the party to reposition it ahead of the 2019 general elections. Oshiomhole, who was elected unopposed on Saturday night, said unlike the 16 years of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) which he said emptied the national treasury, the APC-led government has remained faithful to Nigeria and Nigerians. Oshiomhole said: “This evening (yesterday), there were winners and losers. But we have congratulated ourselves. We must all work for the good of the party.
“As president, Muhammadu Buhari is the only president who retired as a military head of state and was not a millionaire. The only thing he invested was your integrity. Unlike the last government which emptied our national treasury, under your watch, that had not happened. “Saraki and Tambuwal-led other members of PDP to join our party. That move was what gave us victory in 2015. We are not unforgetful of that.
“I am aware that there are challenges here and there. The new leaders elected will be able to surmount those challenges. We will find a way to look for a way to resolve these issues. In states where there are crises, we will find a win-win solution. “I am used to solving challenges. We will organise summits where we will discuss on the way forward. We have the grace and the will to fix our problems. APC will not only be a platform to elect people. We will make it like the ANC (African National Congress in South Africa.) “We are ready to accommodate all the complaints of every member of the party. We can only pay back by ensuring that we rebuild our party as we march towards the 2019 general elections.”
He said he would resume today and swing into action to ensure that everything is in place.

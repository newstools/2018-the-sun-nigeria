Felix Ikem, Nsukka Enugu First Lady Monica Ugwuanyi over the weekend called on stakeholders in children’s upbringing to eschew acts capable of ruining their future. She stated this during a free medical outreach at Itchi-Agu, Igboeze south local government area, through her pet project, Ugo’s Touch of Life Foundation (U-tolf). Ugwuanyi said, “It is ungodly that some teachers and guardians rape and molest children under their charge. Kids need to be treated right because they are learners. Whatever they learn is planted in their subconscious. Let us build a brighter future by instilling virtues in them. I also call on wives to love their husbands to build happy homes.” Council chairman Dr Fidelis Odo, who commended Mrs Ugwuanyi for positively affecting the lives of the needy, reiterated his administration’s commitment towards fair development in line with the rural development agenda of state governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi. He said, “This informed our appointment of 95 persons made up of executive assistants and special assistants from our various communities. Their mandate is to ensure a total victory for Gov. Ugwuanyi come 2019. I also thank Mrs Ugwuanyi for engaging the services of my wife, Prof Uchenna Odo, on health talks, which has enhanced her academic research. I thank Gov. Ugwuanyi for constructing Ibagwa-Aka-Itchi-Unadu-Alor–Agu road among others.” Also speaking, Prof Odo thanked Mrs Ugwuanyi for providing free healthcare to rural dwellers, saying, “This is the first time a wife of a serving governor is coming to Itchi-Agu community.” Chinelo Ugwueze, in a lecture, stressed the need for the consumption of natural food to ensure healthy living. Various speakers, including Hon Dominic Ezema, Mrs Uchenna Utazi, and Hon Matthew Ugwueze of the Enugu State House of Assembly, thanked the First Lady for the outreach as well as Hon Odo for embarking on rural roads to link all communities in the area.

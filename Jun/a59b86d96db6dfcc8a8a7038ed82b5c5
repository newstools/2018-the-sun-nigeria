NAN Joe Jackson, 89, father of the late Michael Jackson is dead. The father of 11, died after a battle with cancer in his Los Angeles home on Wednesday. News of Joe’s death comes two days after the ninth anniversary of Michael’s death. “He had home nursing care and things took a turn and they wanted to rush him to the hospital, but it was too late,” a source close to the Jackson family said, according to Radar online. Joe, who married Katherine in 1949, had a brief music career before putting his sons, including Michael and Jermaine, together in a group called The Jackson 5. After they were signed to Motown in 1968, the family moved to California, where the patriarch supervised the group’s recording sessions and later opened his own record label, establishing the careers of his youngest son, Randy, and daughter Janet.

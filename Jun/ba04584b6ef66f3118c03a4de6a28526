Birmingham City and Aston Villa will reportedly go head-to-head in a battle to sign Liverpool youngster Sheyi Ojo. The 21-year-old, who joined the Reds from MK Dons at the age of 14, spent last season on loan at Fulham and scored four times in 22 league matches. According to Goal.com, the two West Midlands clubs are interested in taking Ojo on loan for next season, and are joined by Stoke City and Derby County in considering a deal for the winger. The source says that Liverpool are keen for the player to be sent out on loan for another season to gain valuable first-team action, before joining the clubâ€™s main group of players. Ojo spent the 2016-17 season with Wolverhampton Wanderers, where the youngster scored two goals in 17 Championship appearances.

Daily Post Naomi Campbell stunned in a pinstriped suit on the Dolce & Gabbana catwalk. She continued her sartorial display as she attended the designer’s Naked King secret show during Milan’s Fashion Week on Saturday. The supermodel, 48, exuded style in a plunging chiffon dress as she headed to the venue with Wizkid, 27, and rapper Tinie Tempah, 29. Naomi sheathed her incredible figure in the black full-length gown, which was adorned with a playing card and astronomy pattern. She accentuated the plunging neckline with a chunky black velvet choker and added a boost to her frame with cream pumps. Styling her raven locks in a poker straight sleek centre-parting, Naomi amped up the glamour with grey eye-shadow, blush-swept cheeks and a slick of brown lipstick. Naomi appeared in high-spirits as she headed to the venue with her rapper pals, who were dressed to impress in bright shirts and chinos. Earlier on in the day, the world-famous supermodel slipped into a snazzy pinstriped suit as she hit the runway for men’s 2019 Spring-Summer collection. Naomi confidently clashed her striped attire with a polka dot bow tie which she wore with her crisp white shirt. The statuesque model made quite the statement when she brought a feminine vibe to the men’s collection catwalk with her sparkling silver stilettos. Head of Italy’s national chamber of fashion Carlo Capasa divulged why women like Naomi and Monica were walking the catwalk for men’s fashion week. Her return to the catwalk comes after the fashion favourite hinted at retirement during a recent interview. Naomi stunned with her revelation, admitting: ‘I don’t know if I can walk much longer, it’s been 32 years.’ The runway queen went on to discuss passing on the baton to her younger counterparts: ‘But it’s an honour to walk… I’d love for it to be carried on by the younger generation and for me to sit in the audience and watch.’

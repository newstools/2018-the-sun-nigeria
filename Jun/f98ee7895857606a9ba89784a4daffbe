The proprietor of Rojenny Games and Tourist Village ,Oba, informed the children that farming naturally attracts miraculous progress if the formulas are adequately applied, noting that the biblical story of how Jesus fed 5000 people with five pieces of bread and two fish is a miracle formula of farming. The Ogilisi Igbo who is also a Board of Trustee (BoT) member of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) said he could replicate the miracle of Jesus Christ with five pieces of bread and two fish to feed 5000 people and even more, noting that such miracle defines what is obtainable in farming. He said: “Five grain of corns can give you bags of corns, two male and female fish can give you thousands of fish.

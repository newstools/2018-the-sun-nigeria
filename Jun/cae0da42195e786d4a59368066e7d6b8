Nollywood actress, Yetunde Akilapa, has again been detained for trying to gain unlawful access into a house in Magodo Shangisha, Lagos. 3 years ago, she was arrested for burglary at a beauty lounge with a master key, after closing hours in Yaba, where she worked, she was beaten to a coma. Following the shameful act Yetunde was given red card as she was banned from the movie industry. Akilipa was arrested yesterday with a bunch of master keys, while trying them on the door of a house in Magodo, unknowing to her that one of the occupants was around. She has since been handed over to the authorities after being beaten a bit.

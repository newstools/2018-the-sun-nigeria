Following Super Eagles’ abysmal performance against Croatia, NFF president, Amaju Melvin Pinnick has called on Nigerian back at home to keep supporting the team with prayers. According to a statement released on the NFF official website yesterday, Amaju said “The Federal Government through the Honourable Minister of Youth and Sports Barrister Solomon Dalung has appealed to Nigerians to keep supporting the team. “The NFF is also appealing to them to continue to encourage the team with kind words and prayers.
Pinnick added that the team still has every opportunity to progress in this tournament as losing the first game is not an automatic exit ticket from the tournament. “Losing your first match of a major competition is not an automatic exit ticket. Spain lost their first match of the 2010 FIFA World Cup finals and still went ahead to win the tournament. So much is still possible “We have a young team that can achieve so much with the right attitude and invention, and we must now reach deep down for those qualities when we play Iceland in Volgograd,” said the NFF boss. Argentina and Iceland, who have one point each, are ahead of Nigeria as well as table –toppers Croatia, but victory against Iceland would earn the Eagles three points and second place in Group D, if Croatia emerged unscathed against Argentina in Nizhni Novgorod on Thursday.

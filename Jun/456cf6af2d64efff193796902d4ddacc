Romanus Ugwu, St Petersburg President Muhammadu Buhari will hold a telephone chat with the Super Eagles players to motivate them for the crucial second group game against Iceland, in Volgograd, Russia, on Friday. Although the President had, before the opening game against Croatia, called the players to wish them well, arrangements had been concluded to call the players again to boast their morale of the team ahead of the Iceland tie. Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), First Vice President, Seyi Akinwunmi, who made the disclosure in St. Petersburg, noted that the team has equally gotten support from the Minister of Sports and the Nigeria embassy in Russia. “The President had called them before the opening match and will still speak with them again before the match against Iceland. “The Minister of Sports is also here with the ambassador. All these things are ways of motivating players. I don’t think that they are lacking in motivation,” he assured. He equally reacted to the players’ social media obsession, revealing that the federation has told them to remain focused instead of distracting themselves reacting to them. “We have addressed the issue and we have tasked them to remain focussed and not to react to anything they see from Nigerians on Social Media. If he did err, I am sure we will address that,” he said.

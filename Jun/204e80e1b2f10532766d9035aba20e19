Eden Hazard sounded out a serious World Cup warning to group rivals England this week.
And the Chelsea and Belgium playmaker then couldn’t resist a dig at the former Three Lions ‘golden generation’ who failed to win a major trophy. Hazard dazzled in the 3-0 win over Egypt on Wednesday for the 45 minutes he was on the pitch despite some brutal treatment. And the 27-year-old forward is just one of a much-fancied Red Devils side that appear to be at the peak of their powers before their assignment in Russia. England’s much-hyped squad of the ‘Noughties’, including Michael Owen, Steven Gerrard, David Beckham, Rio Ferdinand and Paul Scholes, were saddled with the ‘golden’ tag. But there was to be no silverware at either World Cups or European Championships. And Hazard knows the whole of Belgium expects this year, with his world No3-ranked team packed with superstars from the Premier League and elsewhere. “The golden generation thing – you have, 10 years or 15 years ago, this same golden generation in England, but you won nothing. “Now the fans, journalists, all of Belgium, the country just want to win something. We have a golden generation, we just want to win something now. Maybe we can be different to England. “Of course we are very excited about the World Cup, like always. We start the first game in 10 days, so we just want to be there and playing. We are in preparation, but we will be ready for the World Cup when it starts.”

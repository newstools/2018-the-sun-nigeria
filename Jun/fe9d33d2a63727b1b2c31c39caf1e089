Fred Ezeh, Abuja The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has denied reports that it has endorsed President Muhammadu Buhari for the 2019 presidential election and former Edo State governor, Adams Oshiomole’s ambition to contest for the All Preogressives Congress national chairmanship seat. The rebuttal was in response to a report, allegedly sponsored by a political movement, Change Advocates of Nigeria, which shares same acronym with CAN. CAN President, Dr. Samson Ayokunle Olasupo, in a statement by his media aide, Pastor Bayo Oladeji, yesterday, appealed to Nigerians to disregard the report. He also appealed to the political movement to differentiate the acronym, going forward, particularly as political activities gain momentum, ahead of the 2019 general election. “We disassociate ourselves from this particular political group that made this claim, using our acronym ‘CAN,’ so we don’t mislead our people…” said Ayokunle.

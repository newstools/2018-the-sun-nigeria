Julen Lopetegui is under pressure after his side failed to score for the third successive game, losing 1-0 away to CSKA Moscow. Real Madrid are on the club’s worst scoring run for over 11 years after a Champions League loss to CSKA Moscow left Julen Lopetegui’s side without a goal in three games. Madrid battered Roma 3-0 at home in the first game of their latest Champions League defence last month, but the Spanish giants have only found the net once since that win.

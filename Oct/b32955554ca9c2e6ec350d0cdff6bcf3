NAN A Kaduna High Court on Thursday fixed Nov. 7 for ruling on the bail application filed by the leader of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN), Ibrahim Zakzaky and his wife, Zinat. Justice Gideon Kurada adjourned the matter after the prosecution counsel, Dari Bayero, complained of lack of adequate security in Kaduna town. The prosecution explained that the security agencies had drafted personnel to strategic areas of the state to provide security for the visit of the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osibanjo, to Kaduna State. Kurada therefore adjourned the case to Nov. 7, to rule on the bail application.

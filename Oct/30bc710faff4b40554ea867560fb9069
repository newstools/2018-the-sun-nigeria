Laide Raheem, Abeokuta A chieftain of the African Democratic Congress (ADC), in Ogun State, Femi Majekodunmi, has resigned his membership of the party with immediate effect. Majekodunmi, in a release he personally signed and made available to journalists, in Abeokuta, on Thursday, said he has left the ADC to return to his former party, the All Progressives Congress (APC). According to him, he took the decision to return to the APC after due consultations with his family members, relations and political associates within Ogun State and all over the country, stating that he has no regret serving as a member of the ADC. Majekodunmi, who was the caretaker chairman of ADC, in Oyo State, also said he has withdrawn from the Ogun Central senatorial race under the platform of the ADC as a mark of respect to Governor Ibikunle Amosun, stating that, “I am fully back to the APC from my ward in Abeokuta South local government.

Majekodunmi maintained that his return to his former party  was the best decision he could take at the present time and not for selfish interest,  noting that the APC is poised to deliver the dividends of democracy to the people of Ogun State. He, however, said his leaving the ADC did not mean its members are his enemies, saying “as a politician that has served the state in different capacities, I will continue to make myself available to serve the people irrespective of my returning back to the APC.”

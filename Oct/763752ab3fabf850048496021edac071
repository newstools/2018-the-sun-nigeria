Victor Moses is considering his Chelsea future after falling down the pecking order since Maurizio Sarri arrived at the club as head coach, Goal understands. Sarri has come in and transformed Chelsea, who are undefeated in 12 games in all competition, and the switch in formation to 4-3-3 has seen Moses lose his place, with the club’s good form hindering opportunities for reserve players. The 27-year-old became a key player under Antonio Conte as a wing-back but now he falls behind Eden Hazard, Willian and Pedro in the reckoning after being moved further up the pitch to play as a winger. He is just the latest in a group of fringe players who are considering departing the club in January, with Andreas Christensen having recently admitted that he is unhappy with the current level of game time.

Ruben Loftus-Cheek is similarly struggling to make an impact under Sarri and he had several meetings with his manager before deciding to stay over the summer. He remains open to a January loan move, while Gary Cahill has sent mixed messages on his future in recent interviews. Cesc Fabregas is also looking at his options but he is hoping to get a new contract offer from Chelsea and he will likely remain at the club until the end of the season when his current contract will expire. Talented teenager Callum Hudson-Odoi has had some interest in both loan moves and a permanent transfer as January approaches too, but he has been cautious about signing onto a new Chelsea contract without confidence that he will get game time in the first team.

Supporters of Kalu and Wabara were seen in jubilation mood as they vowed to ensure that the APC wins the next elections in the state. Okey Sampson, Aba It was jubilation in Abia North and Abia South senatorial districts, yesterday, when the names of former governor of the state, Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu, and that of Chief Marc Wabara, made the list of the National Independent Electoral Commission (INEC), of those cleared to contest the 2019 senatorial election in the state. An aide to the former governor, Dr. Madukwe Ukaegbu had, in response to a rumour making the rounda about their candidacy, said “Kalu was returned unopposed in Abia North senatorial district; nobody contested it with him. “So, it will be foolhardy for anybody to say that he was not cleared or not given the ticket by his party to contest the coming election. This is politics quite alright but, people must be very careful of how they go about spreading fake news.” Regardless, when Daily Sun visited INEC offices in Abia North and Abia South, Kalu and Wabara’s names were on the lists of those cleared to contest for the senate seats. At the offices visited, supporters of Kalu and Wabara were seen in jubilation mood as they relayed their discontent over the rumour and vowed to ensure that the All Progressives Congress (APC) wins the next elections in the state. “Going through the INEC list, to see the names of Kalu and Wabara who were rumoured not to have been cleared by our party, has given us a huge sigh of relief because we have been in unhappy mood since the fake news broke out”, one of Kalu’s supporters, who declined to be named, said. Speaking on the development, Wabara described those who were spreading the fake news as “mischief makers” who are afraid of their rising profile. He promised to work closely with Kalu and other leaders of the party in the state, to ensure that APC wins Abia in 2019.

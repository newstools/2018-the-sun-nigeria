Fred Itua, Abuja The crisis rocking the Zamfara State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) is far from being over, as chairman of the Senate Committee on Petroleum (Downstream), Kabiru Garba Marafa, has dissociated himself from a purported meeting convened by the national chairman of the party, Adams Oshiomhole, with other governorship aspirants, on Thursday. One of the national dailies had in a story headlined “Oshiomhole meets Zamfara guber aspirants, as party considers Lawal”, reported that Oshiomhole met with the nine governorship aspirants, in Abuja, on Thursday. Marafa, one of the aspirants, in a statement issued, on Friday, said he was not aware of the meeting. Marafa’s statement said, “My attention has been drawn to an online publication headlined: ‘Oshiomhole meets Zamfara Guber aspirants, as party considers Lawal’. “I want to state emphatically that nobody invited me to any meeting after the failed attempt to conduct primaries/consensus as at 12am Sunday 7th Oct 2018. “I want to restate further ( for emphasis) that there was neither election nor consensus reached among APC aspirants in Zamfara state,” he said.

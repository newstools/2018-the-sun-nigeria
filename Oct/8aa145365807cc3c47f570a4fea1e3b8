Police questioned Turkey international midfielder Arda Turan late on Thursday over reports that he fought with a pop star at a night club in Istanbul, the Demiroren news agency (DHA) and other media said. Turan, on loan from Barcelona at Turkish club Istanbul Basaksehir, was summoned by a prosecutor to make a statement to police after they received reports of the player’s clash with singer Berkay Sahin, DHA said. It quoted Turan’s police statement as saying he rejected allegations he harassed Sahin. Berkay was with his wife Ozlem Ada Sahin when the alleged incident happened with Turan and she told local media that the midfielder had made suggestive remarks before attacking her husband.

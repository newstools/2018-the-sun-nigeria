Fred Itua, Abuja Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, has reassured his supporters that he remains a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and has no plans of leaving the party. In a statement on his Facebook page, @iamekweremadu, on Wednesday, the Senator wrote: “I am presently out of the country on a pre-scheduled engagement. “In the past 24 hours, I have been inundated with calls from friends and political associates seeking clarification on the rumours of my departure from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), which has dominated the media. “Let it be known that my path in politics is in the hands of the Almighty God, who has indeed been very faithful and gracious to me. I’m very grateful to God for this. “My vision in politics is a system that works for everybody; a social and political environment where everybody, every section, and every tribe not only counts, but is also seen to count.

I am indeed humbled by your kind words of solidarity and support. “Please, rest assured that I am still in the PDP”. There were reports of pressure on the Senator by his political associates to dump the PDP over perceived disrespect to his person and his alienation in critical issues concerning the PDP,  which they believe he contributed so much to its survival after the 2015 electoral defeat. They cite his non-inclusion or involvement in the constitution of the Presidential Campaign Council and other issues concerning the party.

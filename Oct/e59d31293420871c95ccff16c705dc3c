Uche Usim, Abuja The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), on Monday announced a trading surplus of N18.12 billion for May 2018. The figure is higher than the trading surplus of N17.16 billion recorded in April. Details of the transactions contained in the recently released May 2018 edition of the monthly NNPC Financial and Operations Reports also indicated that the additional monthly trading surplus of N0.96 billion was mainly due to increased performance of some of the Corporation’s subsidiaries namely, the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC), Petroleum Products Marketing Company (PPMC), Nigerian Pipelines and Storage Company (NPSC) and Marine Logistics. During the period under review, the NNPC group performance was mainly impacted by NPDC’s activities, which recorded a favourable variance of N18.22 billion due to increase in revenue with attendant decline in expenses. This resulted in N20.93 billion net increase in the upstream gas and power surplus.
Overall, the report indicated that the increase in performance was bolstered by the relatively high production volumes of 1.97 million barrels per day in April 2018, which was sold in May 2018 thereby reducing cost per unit.

Hughie Fury was beaten on a unanimous points decision by Bulgarian Kubrat Pulev in his IBF heavyweight eliminator in Sofia. All three judges scored the fight in favour of 37-year-old Pulev, who now becomes the mandatory IBF challenger to Anthony Joshua. Fury, the 24-year-old cousin of Tyson Fury, came into the fight with a 21-1 record – his only loss coming against Joseph Parker in Manchester last September. Fury sustained a bad cut above his left eye in only the second round and, although he rocked Pulev with a big right hand in the eighth, the Bulgarian came out well on top, with one judge scoring the fight 118-110.

Despite that, I gave it my all, went the full twelve rounds and ran him close. “It was a big ask for my fans to travel all this way and I want to thank them for coming out in force to show their support.” Trainer and father, Peter Fury added: “Hughie came into the fight with a cut above the eye. He was stitched up two weeks ago but they [the doctors] said it would heal in time for the fight and obviously it didn’t.” “Pulev caught him with a jab and split it right open. From that moment in the second round it was an uphill battle. I’m proud of my son – he was fighting on away soil, injured, yet he still went the full distance.” “If the cut hadn’t happened we would have seen a different outcome.”

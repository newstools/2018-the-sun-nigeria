Okey Sampson, Aba Spokesman of the family of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Prince Emmanuel Kanu, has said his brother has no interest in the ouster of President Muhammadu Buhari from office and has therefore not discussed the issue with anybody. Emmanuel, who spoke against the backdrop of a statement credited to a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Femi Fani-Kayode, to the effect that the IPOB leader called and told him on phone that he (Kanu) was going to join forces with the party to oust Buhari from office, said Kanu and the IPOB family remain apolitical and are only interested in realising Biafra and nothing more.

What my brother had done was to make calls to some few people to thank them and tell them of his condition and that’s what it is. There was nothing like that, he never told Fani-Kayode that he (Kanu) will join hands with them to oust President Buhari.” Emmanuel, who said he has been in constant touch with Kanu since he resurfaced in Israel, where he was seen praying at the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem, said: “The stand of Nnamdi Kanu and IPOB is that we will remain apolitical, that’s what he believes in and that’s what we are doing, so, for anybody to say Kanu told them he will join hands with them to remove Buhari, the person is not saying the truth and he is missing the mark.

Nigerians in the Diaspora, under the umbrella of European Coalition for Security and Democracy in Nigeria (ECSDN) will hold an online poll November 1 to vote for a presidential candidate from among the 74 candidates approved by INEC for the 2019 presidential elections holding in February 2019. In a statement from Hungary based ECSDN, Fafore Adebowale Abiodun, a cordinator of the platform stated that the election will take place live on ECSDN’s youtube channel, Nelson M46664  on November 1 by 5pm Nigerian time. In a related speech which has gone viral, the Global Coordinator of the coalition, Frederick Odorige stated that it was shameful to see that members of the political class are engaged in fights which have culminated in the death of innocent Nigerians because of their greed and lust for power. Odorige stated that for too long, Nigerians have been short-changed by the political class and urged Nigerians to use the 2019 general elections to say no to insecurity, disenfranchisement, corruption, rigging, bogus salaries for federal legislators, murderous herdsmen, health tourism for public office holders, budget padding, detention of Nigerians without trial, recycled leaders and indiscriminate allocation of oil blocs among others.

Who ever emerges will get the support of ECSDN and by extension, the Nigerian Diaspora during the 2019 elections.” ECSDN is a project organised by the Nelson M46664 Human Rights Association Hungary.

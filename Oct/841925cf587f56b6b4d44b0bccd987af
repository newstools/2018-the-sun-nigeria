Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan Students of the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH) in Oyo State, shut down the host communities, Ogbomoso and Osogbo, capital of Osun State, on Wednesday, over new tuition fees. In the new tuition regime, signed by the institution’s Registrar, J. A. Agboola, with effect from 2018/2019 academic session, which was announced on Monday, indigene students of the owner states (Oyo and Osun) will pay N200,000 per session while non-indigenes will pay N250,000. The October 15 was addressed to all students and marked REG/ADM.38. Prior to the new tuition regime, as gathered, students of Oyo and Osun states origin paid N63,500 per session, while non-indigenes paid N72, 500.

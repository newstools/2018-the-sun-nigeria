The 2017 National U-18 sprint champion told the media in Buenos Aires that she is satisfied with her performance. “I am happy and satisfied because before coming to Argentina I did not have good results,” Chukwuma said. “I was scared that I would not get what I hoped for at these Games. I did not think that it was possible, but God sees to everything. I started to train in 2016 and I traveled to Australia last year to prepare in this discipline, then continued training in Nigeria.” Chukwuma was part of the country’s 4×100 women’s team that won gold at the African Senior Athletics Championship in Asaba this year. She also won gold at the 100m and 200m at the 2018 Africa Youth Games in Algeria.

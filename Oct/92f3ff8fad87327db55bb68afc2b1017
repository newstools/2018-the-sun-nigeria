Neymar is said to regard Barca as ‘his club’ and he has not been motivated by playing in Ligue 1, with PSG already eight points clear at the top of the table. The French champions were easily beaten by Real Madrid in the first knockout round of last season’s Champions League after Neymar was bought for a world record £198million to help them challenge for the trophy. The Spanish newspaper also believe that Kylian Mbappe’s emergence has put the Brazilian in the ‘shadows’ at PSG, despite his superstar status.

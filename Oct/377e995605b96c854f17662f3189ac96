The 19-year-old player said; ”I’m so happy playing this tournament second time. There is high level of competitiveness in the Lagos Open. This is so because any tournament in the range of $25,000 always see tough players coming around to play. “I didn’t do badly judging from the time I arrived the country two days ago and the time I played today. I have not been able to aclimatize very well. But I was so happy playing in the tournament “I was here in 2015 and I can see that the organisational aspect has gone professional from the venue and the hotel. I think the organisers can improve on what is on ground now for future tournaments.”

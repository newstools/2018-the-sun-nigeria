Aberdeen have signed Manchester City midfielder Chidiebere Nwakali on loan until the end of the season.
Confirming his capture, the Manager of Aberdeen said the 21 year old is a player they have been working on signing for some time now, and he hope he will be a positive addition to their team.
The manager also revealed that, Manchester City’s desire for Nwakali to have more game time also played in their favour, when they approached the Etihad outfit for the Nigerian.
“Manchester City have been very keen for Chidi to get some competitive game time and it’s a deal we’ve been working on for a couple of months now,” manager Derek McInnes told the official websit of Aberdeen.
“I’m sure he will be a positive addition to our squad.”
An Under-17 World Cup winner in 2013, Nwakali is a central holding player who scored four goals in 26 appearances for Sogndal in last year’s Tippeligaen.
Nwakali joined Man City in 2015 alongside Kelechi Iheanacho, but unlike Iheanacho he failed to break into the squad, which has lead to him spending time on loan with four different teams.
His time on loan with Malaga and Girona in Spain didn’t go well, but a move to Norway where he turned out for ‎IK Start helped him display some of the attributes that made City sign him.
He joins Aberdeen from Norwegian side Sogndal , and just like IK Start where he played the previous season in same Norway‎, Sogndal were also relegated to the second division in Norway.
Comfortable as a right full back, central defender or as a central midfielder, he has represented Nigeria at U17 and 20 level, and was a part of the Nigerian senior team for the friendly game against Argentina, but he didn’t get to play.

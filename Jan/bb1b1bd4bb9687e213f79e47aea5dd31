The Jigawa State Environmental Protection Agency (JISEPA) has advised restaurant owners, food vendors and other traders to keep their premises neat to reduce food contamination. Acting Managing Director of JISEPA, Alhaji Umar Amadu, gave the advice in an interview, in Dutse, on Thursday. Amadu urged restaurant owners and food vendors to desist from operating close to where people urinate or defecate. He also advised them to ensure their stewards use aprons, head gears and mouth masks while on duty. Amadu said the gesture would prevent hair and avoid cough or sneeze from entering the foods they are serving. “They must also cut their nails to the lowest level so that it does not house germs and dirt which can be transferred into the foods they served. “If they obey environmental regulations in their premises, I am certain it will ensure production and consumption of healthy food, improve hygiene and general public health in the state,’’ he said. Amadu said that the agency would ensure that foods from restaurants and other vendors were safe and clean for public consumption. According to him, other petty traders, canteen owners within and outside various markets in the state must ensure that they keep their premises clean and tidy all the time. (NAN)

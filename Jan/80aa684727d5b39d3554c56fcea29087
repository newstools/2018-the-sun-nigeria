South Korean President Moon Jae In is willing to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un “under the right conditions,” the South Korean leader said in Seoul on Wednesday. “He would agree to a meeting if there were prospects for tangible results,’’ Moon said. He added that avoiding another war and a Korean peninsula free of nuclear weapons were the main goals. Moon, a day after breakthrough talks which saw officials on both sides agree to three key steps for reconciliation, stressed that he would push for further talks between the two countries. On Tuesday, both sides agreed on the North’s participation in the upcoming Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, an easing of military tensions and the active pursuit of resolution-driven dialogues. The deal came after Pyongyang reopened a military hotline with Seoul, which had remained dormant since February 2016 after the closure of a jointly operated industrial park. Analysts say North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s attempt to restore dialogue with Seoul could be a gambit intended to drive a wedge between South Korea and the US. Report says the two Koreans remain in a technical state of war. It noted that the 1950 to 1953 Korean War ended only in a ceasefire, but no peace deal was ever signed. (NAN)

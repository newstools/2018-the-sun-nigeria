The Federal Government has approved the upgrade of the Material Science and Flight Safety Laboratories, which will help the Accident Investigation Bureau (AIB) to speedily investigate plane crashes. Mr. Akin Olateru, the Commissioner of AIB, confirmed the development to newsmen yesterday on the sidelines of the ongoing training on accident investigation report writing organised by the bureau in Lagos. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) quoted Olateru as noting that the cost could be on the high side due to the fact that both facilities would be upgraded with modern technology. He said the contract for the laboratories started in 2008 and was executed in 2012, adding that the software that was now obsolete and needed to be upgraded. According to him, “as at today, when you look at it very well, the software is obsolete. If you buy your computer in 2008 and compare it to what we have in 2018, you will see you need to upgrade the software. “There must be some upgrade. It is just to upgrade what we have and to incorporate very important components, which is the training side of it. “This is part of this contract, to continuously train people on how to use the equipment and the analysis of the data is the one that is most critical and you can’t train an expert in one week. It is an ongoing thing and that is the whole essence of the upgrade.”

#BringBackOurGirls (BBOG) spokesman, Sesugh Akume, said in a statement, on Thursday. He said the group has confirmed that the news of Salomi release is true. “Salomi Pogu is a daughter of Mallam Pogu Yahi from Kaumutahyahi, a village in Kuburmbula ward of Chibok LGA. Both her parents are currently IDPs in Rumirgo Village, in nearby Askira/Uba LGA in Borno State,” Akume disclosed. He however commended the military for bringing down the number of the missing girls with the rescue of Salomi at Pulka, Borno State from 113 to 112. The military has claimed Salomi was on number 86 on the lists of Chibok school girls yet to be seen. This brings the number of our missing #ChibokGirls to 112. We are yet to ascertain further details about Jamila Adams and the baby. Our monthly #BBOGMarchToTheVilla for our #ChibokGirls (and others) for the month of January comes up from Tuesday 23 January.

Former Governor of Abia State and Chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Dr. Orji Kalu has lamented the demise of former Governor of the defunct Kaduna State, Alhaji Lawal Kaita.
While extolling the virtues of the deceased, Kalu acknowledged the roles played by the late Alhaji Kaita in the political development of Nigeria.
He stressed that the demise of the consummate politician has created a big vacuum in the Nigerian political space.
In a statement signed by his Special Adviser, Kunle Oyewumi, Kalu noted that the late elder statesman’s wise counsel on national issues will be greatly missed.
He said, “Nigeria has lost yet another consummate politician and patriotic statesman, Alhaji lawal Kaita.
“The deceased was forthright, bold and selfless in his pursuits.
“He left behind worthy legacies for other politicians to emulate.
“May Allah forgive his shortcomings and grant him Al- Jannah Firdaus.
The APC chieftain while commiserating with President Muhammadu Buhari, Katsina Emirate Council and the government and people of Katsina state, prayed to Allah to grant the Kaita family the fortitude to bear the loss.

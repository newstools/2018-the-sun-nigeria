From James Ojo, Abuja  FOLLOWING the re-validation of the memorandum of understanding with the British government, the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) has said it was expecting evidence-recording equipment to facilitate its operations. Other benefits from the MOU include the re-modelling of the detention facility of the Lagos office, as well as operational vehicles. Spokesperson of the commission, Mrs. Rasheedat Okoduwa, in a statement, said that ICPC would also enjoy local and international capacity-building and training programmes to support the commission. She stated that the commission was lauded by the British government for curtailing the scourge of visa racketeering. The commendation came from the regional manager for Africa (Immigration and Enforcement), British High Commission, Mrs. Nicola Marrs, when she paid a visit to the commission. Mrs. Marrs, who was in company with the regional capacity building manager for East and West Africa, Mr. Liam Harrison, revealed that the High Commission had recorded very few cases of visa-related fraud since its collaboration with ICPC began in 2013. As a result, she said that the High Commission was set to re-validate the on-going collaboration with a draft MOU with ICPC to assist in achieving its mandate. Acting chairman of the ICPC, Hon. Bako Abdullahi, commended the good gesture of the British High Commission while affirming that the ICPC was poised to do more as operational resources are placed at its disposal.

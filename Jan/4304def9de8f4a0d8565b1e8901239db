Nollywood actress, Calista Okoronkwo, famous for her Nurse Titi role in award winning sitcom, Clinic Matters, is bent on putting a stop to the common generalization that all actresses are ‘runs girls’ and can’t make a good home. The University of Nigeria, Nsukka, graduate of Economics recalled how she had an unpleasant encounter with a male friend who had that ugly impression of actresses. Hear her: ‘’That fateful day I went out with my sister  to have a meal with a male friend. It was our first meeting. We were having a great conversation, then in a blink of an eye, the guy spoiled the entire mood and said “what do you have to say about the fact that people see actresses as hustlers?” He didn’t stop there. He went further to say he works with lots of top guns in Nigeria and he knows a couple of them who date actresses. In a split second, the food went from good to bad…evening went from great to bad. Our conversation turned sour. How do you say something like that to someone you are just meeting for the first time over a meal?” The  Celebrity Marriage star actress, said in her swift reactions towards her male friend’s presumptions, she found them  unacceptable. “Well, I actually saw that question as immature because the generalization is just unforgivable. If that question was coming from someone I have known for a while, it won’t have been as offensive as it was. “Trust my sister, she just stood right up and walked away. I did my best to maintain composure . It took the Grace of God for me to be calm. Actresses are not all the terrible things you call them! Just like there are still good people around, there are still good actresses around. Please let them stop this generalization. We are not strays,” she pleaded.

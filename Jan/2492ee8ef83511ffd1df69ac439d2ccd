In his usual manner of not mincing words and not minding whose horse is gored, ace humour merchant, I Go Dye, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari not to seek re-election but transfer political leadership to the youths. The comedian, who poured out his heart in a letter to the president, charged him to be a hero rather than a villain in the history books of the nation. Part of the letter from I Go Dye reads: “I look back at our history as a people and the many opportunities that have been denied the youths of my generation. The youths of today are grieving everyday, because so much has been taken away from them. They have been denied the right to good life, quality education, freedom, justice, sustainable means of livelihood and above all, the freedom to leadership. “These opportunities were given in the past, remarkably many great Nigerians including your humble self, enjoyed the very best from our great country. How come my generation has been short-changed and left in desolation and uncertainty? “Sir, I am not against your political ambition, neither am I opposing your interest, but I am of the view that it’s better to leave the stage when the ovation is loudest. Honestly speaking, there is nothing new for you to conquer; the only sacrifice that will bring more honour to your personality is for you to lead the process of advancing and transferring political leadership to the youths. The best gift that you can obviously give to my generation is to activate and set the process of ending the long and over-due political recycling that has denied the youths their rightful place in our political history as a nation.”

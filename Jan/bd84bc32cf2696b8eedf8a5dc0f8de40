By George Aluo Former Super Eagles winger, Emmanuel Amuneke has given a pat on the back to the Confederation of African Football (CAF) over what he called “the better packaged” African footballer of the year award which took place Thursday in Accra, Ghana. Amuneke a winner of the award in 1994 told Sunday Sunsports after the event that CAF and the new sponsor of prestigious show deserve kudos. “What we saw today is good for African football. I m impressed with what the new leadership of CAF is doing, especially their decision to recognize ex-internationals who in their heyday did Africa proud.” Amuneke who handed over the coach of the year award to Egypt’s Hector Cupper had before presenting the award thumbed up organizers of the event. Amuneke was one of the several football legends that graced the Accra show courtesy of the sponsors, Aiteo. Apart from gracing the show, the soccer legends played major roles on the night, with former Ivorian skipper, Didier Drogba serving as one of the comperes alongside South African diva Carol Tshabalala.

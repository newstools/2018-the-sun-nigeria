From Uche Usim, Abuja For better forecasting and accurate analysis, the Federal Government has tasked the Aviation Statistical Committee to ensure that reliable aviation data are produced to support the nation’s economic growth. The Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Transportation, Sabiu Zakari, while delivering his welcome address at opening ceremony of the 2nd Aviation Statistical Committee meeting held Keffi, Nassarawa State recently, said the Ministry was mandated to produce and provide the country’s aviation statistics, as well as managing statistical system which encompasses the six major aviation agencies. The Permanent Secretary disclosed the Ministry has earned the trust and recognition of the government, public agencies and private organizations in providing credible statistical data that are widely utilized in policy formulation and development of plans. This, according to him, informed the need to lay a more appropriate statistical foundation to support the emerging needs of policy making and to meet the global acceptable standard. Zakari noted that the government was aware of the importance of having a sustained and cohesive statistical structure to ensure the continuity and growth of the sector. He reminded the participants that without access to adequate information, reliable statistical data and trained personnel, the result-based structure may fall short of achieving its intended objectives. “Policy making requires statistical information that is contextualized, well-structured and concise. It is essential that statistical indicators are based on reliable sources that employ appropriate methodologies, that is, the technical and statistical competence to collect, process and produce accurate data”. According to him the challenges of a rapidly changing world, especially in the aviation industry has brought up the need for flexibility in adapting to new methodologies of data production, and therefore charged the Committee to explore all the possibilities to quickly adjust the mechanism of statistical production to support the emerging development in the industry.

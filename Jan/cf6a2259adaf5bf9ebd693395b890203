Governor Ayodele Fayose of Ekiti State has described former President Olusegun Obasanjo’s letter to President Muhammadu Buhari as ‘belated and self-serving’. According to a press statement by his Chief Press Secretary issued, in Ado-Ekiti, on Wednesday,  Governor Fayose said, ” It is a face-saving letter after Obasanjo, who led the cabals  that imposed Buhari, had seen that Nigerians have turned back from following the president. “Damning as the Obasanjo letter was and although it makes some sense, the writer is not deserving of the letter. Obasanjo is not the right person to write that letter,” Fayose insisted. The Ekiti State governor continued, “He (Obasanjo) was the leader of those who deceived Nigerians and lied to the international community  to support Buhari. Nigerians have already made up their minds to show Buhari the exit next year with or without Obasanjo’s self-serving letter “So, Obasanjo should not take the credit. He should not reap where he has not sown. Nevertheless, President Buhari should heed ex-President Obasanjo’s advice and go home and rest. President Buhari has overstayed his welcome.” “Obasanjo himself should heed his own advice to Buhari by also going home to rest. Both Obasanjo and Buhari are analogue in this digital age and have expired. We have been hearing of Obasanjo since we were in the primary school. It is time for him to vacate the public political space.  When Nigerians hear him speak nowadays, they hiss,” the governor.

By Joe Apu Captain of Nigeria’s Super Eagles B squad Ikechukwu Ezenwa has declared that the team is well prepared to take on the rest of Africa in the 5th African Nations Championship taking place in Morocco from 13th January – 4th February 2018. According to Ezenwa who spoke with the nff.com stated that the team’s preparation has been going on well. “We have been playing some friendly games and I must say it has been good preparation all round. “The camping here in Nigeria is coming to an end we are in good shape to continue the next phase of preparation in Morocco ahead of our first match.”On the team’s target in Morocco, Ezenwa said, “First of all, we are going to take each game as it comes; we have had very good preparation so far and the unity in the team is awesome and with that, I am confident of a better outing than the last time in Rwanda. “Rwanda, Libya and Equatorial Guinea are very good sides when it comes to the CHAN tournament. Look at the last edition, Rwanda were very tough and they performed better than us. “Libya are former champions so they are no newcomers to the competition and for Equatorial Guinea, they will be coming with the bunch of players that played the World Cup qualifiers for them, so to be honest, it’s going to be a very tough group for us but we are up to the task. Speaking on the chances of players from the domestic league making the FIFA World Cup squad through their performance at the CHAN tournament; Ezenwa observed that any player that does very well will have an opportunity. “This is because the Technical Adviser, Gernot Rohr will be in Morocco with us just like he was with us in Ghana where some players who did well were invited for the FIFA World Cup qualifier against Zambia. “So, I strongly believe anyone who proves himself well will definitely get a look-in, but the most important thing for us right now is to go to Morocco and do the nation proud by winning the trophy,” he noted.

• As Chelsea salutes Aina By Monica Iheakam Report emerging from London indicates that Leicester are preparing to offload Super Eagles striker Kelechi Iheanacho Ihaencho who joined The Foxes from Manchester City  on £25million in August 2017, was only given a 10-minute runout against League One minnows Fleetwood in a 0-0 draw FA Cup on Saturday. According to Sun of London, Leicester is considering letting the 21 -year-old Nigerian international who has mad e just two Premier League starts go. A well-placed source said: “The problem is Kelechi is earning around £115,000-a-week on a five-year deal and no club will currently want to take him on those wages. “So Leicester might have to let him go for a lot cheaper than they paid for him if they decide to sell now.” Newcastle boss Rafa Benitez was interested in the summer and the likes of Stoke, West Ham and Swansea were also in the hunt. Boss Claude Puel does not see him being part of his plans anytime soon. And he hardly gave him a ringing endorsement when asked if fans can expect to see more of him given the huge outlay the club made. In a cheering development, Chelsea have congratulated Super Eagles defender Ola Aina for scoring his first-ever goal as a professional. The former England U-19 skipper achieved the feat in the 58th minute of Hull City’s 1-0 win over Blackburn Rovers in the Emirates FA Cup on Saturday, January 6. Aina overcame an injury scare to thump home a towering header which was enough to give Hull City a win. ‘’Delighted with our FA Cup win, buzzing to have got my first senior goal! Onto the next round #hcafc,’’ Ola Aina tweeted. Chelsea retweeted the post, then added : ‘’Congrats, Ola! ’’. Aina put an end to a thirty-match and 2,417 minutes goal drought with his headed goal against an in-form Blackburn Rovers side. Chelsea teammate Ike Ugbo also progressed to the fourth round of the competition with his new club MK Dons.

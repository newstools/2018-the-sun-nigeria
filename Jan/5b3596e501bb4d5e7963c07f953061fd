More than three million tickets have been requested in the second phase of applications for this year’s FIFA World Cup in Russia. The second window for fans seeking to attend the event opened on December 5, after the draw for the group stage of the tournament on December 1. In all, 3,141,163 tickets have been requested since then with the ticket phase coming to a close on January 31. Most of the applications have come from hosts Russia, with Germany, Argentina, Mexico, Brazil, Peru, Colombia, United States, Spain, Poland and China the top ten countries from abroad. In all, international demand has accounted for 38 per cent of ticket requests. Random selection draws will allocate tickets in games which are oversubscribed. Any remaining tickets will then be available from March 13 to April 3 on a first come, first served basis. The first sales window was split into two parts and began on September 14, where fans could apply for tickets despite not knowing the make-up of the groups. More than 620,000 tickets were allocated in this phase. Tickets are available to request online with fans able to apply for individual match tickets for all games, except the opening Group A fixture between Russia and Saudi Arabia and the final. Venue-specific and team-specific tickets can also be requested. All fans attending matches at the World Cup need to apply for a “FAN ID” following a request from the Russian authorities. It is designed to ensure those associated with hooliganism and fan violence at football matches are unable to gain access to stadiums. Russian fans were involved in violent clashes with England supporters in Marseille at the 2016 UEFA European Championships in France.

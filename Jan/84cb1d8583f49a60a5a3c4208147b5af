As the sale of Mitros rice to the public at designated centres continues after it was launched, buyers have continued to commend the state government for making the product available at reasonable prices. An opinion poll conducted by pressmen indicated that residents who besieged the various sales points in the state expressed satisfaction with the continuous availability of the rice and the courteous way they were attended to. Mr. Taiwo Saula, who resides in Abeokuta, said with the continuous availability of the product, the state government has disappointed sceptics who thought the rice would disappear immediately after the official launch late last year, adding that the uninterrupted sale was an indication that government actually meant business and was ready to stop rice importation in the nearest future. “Aside from this, the Mitros rice is also cheap, affordable, fresh and sweet,’’ he said. Mrs. Olasunbo Sotayo from Sawonjo, Yewa North Local Government Area, said the traceability of the Ofada rice made it attractive to her as she could easily identify the source, adding that with proper milling, the state government has taken the once local Ofada rice to another level, saying she was proud to witness the transformation. Another  resident of Abeokuta, Mrs. Beatrice Olayomi, expressed delight with the proper measurement of various categories of bags on sale. “I bought two 25kg Mitros Ofada rice during the festive period and to my surprise, they are real 25kg instead of those in the open market that are labelled 25kg but are less than 20kg,’’ she said. Meanwhile, the state Commissioner for Agriculture, Mrs. Adepeju Adebajo, said the Mitros rice would soon be made available in all major markets across the state in standardised bags of 1kg, 5kg, 10kg, 25kg and 50kg for both the parboiled and Ofada.

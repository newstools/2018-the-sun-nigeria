 In 2010, he rode into the industry on the back of his hit single, Gaga Going Crazy with the force of a hurricane. However, a couple of years later, the act known as Chuddy K went into oblivion, and despite releasing a couple of singles, he is yet to find his feet. Recently, TS Weekend ran into him and he opened up on what he has been up to lately. “I have been working on stuff, like trying to set up a record label and trying to bring out new songs. I released a song, Ekelebe in February 2017 and I am having a reality show coming up soon. I am going back to the slums where I started and I’ll be reaching out to up and coming acts. My fans should watch out, I would be back with a bang!” Responding to people who described him as one-album star, Chuddy said: “You have to believe in yourself before doing something, so I believe in what I have; the passion took me where I wanted to be and the passion is still there. I have lots of songs which have not gone on air, so they should watch out for Chuddy K in 2018 and beyond.”

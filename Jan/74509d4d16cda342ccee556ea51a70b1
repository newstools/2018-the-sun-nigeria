The 50-year-old Ugandan  man identified as Mohammed Ssemanda married three women in one ceremony because he could not afford separate wedding functions. “My wives are not jealous of each other. Good enough, each one has got a home and I promise to work harder and support them,” he was quoted as saying by Daily Mail. Ssemanda who is a food vendor in Kampala suburb, renewed his marriage contract to one of his brides, Salamat Naluwugge, who he had married 20 years ago, and also wed two sisters, Jameo Nakayiza, 27, and Mastulah Nakayiza, 24. Talking about her husband’s goodness, his first wife said, “I thank our husband for marrying us all at once; it is a sign that he will not discriminate or take sides with any of us.” (KhaleejTimes)

Molly Kilete, Abuja Officers of the Nigeria Police Force, yesterday, barred the Bring Back Our Girls (BBOG) group from taking their protest to the Presidential Villa, to demand the unconditional release of the remaining kidnaped Chibok girls. The group has been demanding the release of girls kidnapped from Government Secondary School, Chibok, by Boko Haram, on April 14, 2014. They were chased from their usual meeting point at the Unity Fountain in Abuja, where they had assembled as early as 9:00am, to deliberate on the mode of the protest. Police personnel from the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Command were deployed to disperse the group. However, some BBOG members, on sensing the police move, dispersed in smaller groups, so as not to be identified by the police and succeeded in moving to the entrance of Aso Rock, while others remained behind. The police team led by the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) in charge of Asokoro police division, one Hajia Aisha, stationed both male and female personnel on the road leading to the villa, with some plain clothes personnel. Some BBOG members who spoke to journalists, vowed never to be intimidated by the security agencies, in agitating for the release of the kidnapped Chibok girls.

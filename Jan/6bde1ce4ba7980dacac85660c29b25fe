From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan Oyo State Government yesterday received 11 natives of the state rescued from Libya, after they had undergone various prison terms and inhuman treatments in search of greener pasture in Europe. The returnees, comprising six females and five males, were received by the state Deputy Governor, Moses Adeyemo and Executive Secretary of the state Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Akin Makinde, at the governor’s office, Ibadan. Daily Sun gathered that another eight returnees from Oyo State have been taken from Libya to Port Harcourt in Rivers State, from where they will be transported to Ibadan. Addressing the returnees, the deputy governor said: “Oyo State Government has taken it upon itself to make sure all indigenes of the state are brought to the government’s secretariat and, later, we will reunite them with their families. “But, my advice to the youths is that those of them who have certificates should know that the academic qualifications are just avenues for them to learn something in addition to their qualifications.” On his part, Makinde told newsmen that Governor Abiola Ajimobi has charged the agency to look at what could be done for the returnees “and we will work on it very quickly. “As I am talking to you, another plane has arrived in Port Harcourt and Oyo State is having eight among those that arrived on Sunday. They are being kept in Port Harcourt now,” he said.

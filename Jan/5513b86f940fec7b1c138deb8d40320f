Molly Kilete, Abuja The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) police command seems to have given up on the Bring Back Our Girls (#BBOG) group as they were allowed to embark on their peaceful protest without harassment like they did, on Tuesday. They were, however, restricted from gaining access to the presidential villa, where they had intend to meet President Muhammadu Buhari to present their letter of protest to him. Members of my the group, who assembled at their usual Unity Fountain square, at about 9 o’clock in the morning, embarked on the peaceful protest at about 10 o’clock in the presence of some police personnel who provided escort for them until they got to the major road linking the presidential villa, where they were stopped. Unlike, on Tuesday, when the police turned out in their large number and prevented the group from embarking on their protest, while their leaders and some other members were arrested, the Wednesday scenario was very different as the police restricted their presence to just blocking the road and having no altercations with the group. Also on ground were some personnel of the Department of State Security (DSS), who kept watch over the protesters from a distance as well as men of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), who ensured a free flow of traffic in the area. In an interview with newsmen, Dr. Oby Ezekwesili, demanded an apology from President Buhari over the harassment suffered by the group on Tuesday. She said despite the intimidation by the Federal Government, the security agencies and other groups in the country, the group would not give up its struggle until all the kidnapped Chibok school girls and other captives in custody of the Boko Haram terrorists group were released safe and alive. The group, before leaving the area at about 12.44p.m, asked for the leader of the security agencies on ground but got no response. Dr. Ezekwsili, however, told the security personnel that they would be back to continue with their protest.

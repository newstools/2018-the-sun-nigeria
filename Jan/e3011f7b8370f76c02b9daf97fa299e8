The organisers of the IAAF World Indoor Championships Birmingham 2018 event have unveiled the medals that will be awarded to the top three in each final when the event is staged at Arena Birmingham from 1 to 4 March to mark 50 days to go.
The Local Organising Committee challenged students at Birmingham City University’s School of Jewellery to design the medals and then selected the winning design, the work of second year silversmith and jewellery student Menna Jones, at the end of last year.
Jones chose to focus on three Birmingham landmarks as part of her design and said: “I’m delighted that my design has been chosen and I can’t believe some of the world’s best athletes will be awarded a medal featuring my work when they come to the city in March.
“I wanted my medal to be a strong reflection of Birmingham and highlight what the city has to offer. I wanted to design a medal that the athletes could link to city of Birmingham, with its unique, individual features and landmarks. My medal will be a memento of the city, allowing the athletes to remember the special time they’ve experienced here.” The medal design features three famous city centre buildings: the city’s historic Town Hall, in Victoria Square, and two buildings which have been part of the city’s landscape in more recent years – the Selfridges building, and the new Library of Birmingham, Europe’s largest public library.

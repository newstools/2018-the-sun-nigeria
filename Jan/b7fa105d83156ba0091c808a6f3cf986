Appropriate behaviours and conducts for young folks who are going into love relationship or courtship is the focus of the new episode of Glo-sponsored TV Drama Series, Professor Johnbull. The new episode entitled Meal Ticket, which comes up on Tuesday at 8.30 p.m. on NTA Network, NTA International on DSTV Channel 251 and NTA on StarTimes is a moral lesson for ladies going into relationships, with Professor Johnbull (Kanayo O Kanayo) of Nollywood fame expatiating on what courtship is all about. Meal Ticket tells the story of typical courtship in which ladies rely on their partners to provide for their day to day needs without getting means of self-sustenance. In the new episode, Jumoke (Bidemi Kosoko) dumped her broke boyfriend, Flash (Stephen Odimgba) and started a new relationship with a loafer who lives off another girlfriend and drives her car. However, the bubble bust when the girlfriend eventually found out that her loafer lover boy had been feeding off her and decided to loan him off to Jumoke. The episode clearly highlights how young men aptly described by Professor Johnbull as “fine-boy-six-packs with no ambition to be responsible” feed off ladies, all in the name of love. The erudite Professor, who explained that it is normal for boyfriends to assist their girlfriends financially whenever the need arises and subject to their financial capability, also counseled ladies not to take it as their rights, adding that women with dignity and self-worth earn more respect from men. “Ladies, groom yourselves to be independent rather than being liabilities. You should not be commodities to be rented and paid for. Believing that you have to be paid for, for being in a relationship reduces your self-worth and limits your dreams of being an independent woman”, the scholar admonishes. Meal Ticket also parade other regulars including Elizabeth (Queen Nwokoye), Olaniyi (Yomi Fash-Lanso), Abadnego (Martins Nebo), Nje (Angela Okorie) and Jeroboam, aka Boam (Osita Iheme).

Aderonke Bello English Premier League club, Watford FC sacks coach, Marco Silva after eight months of engagement with the Hertfordshire club. The club statement read: â€œThis has been a difficult decision and one not taken lightly. The club is convinced the appointment of Silva was the right one and had it not been for the unwarranted approach by a Premier League rival for his services we would have continued to prosper under his leadership.

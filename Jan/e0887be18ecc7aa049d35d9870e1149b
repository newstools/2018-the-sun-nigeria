Edo State Commissioner of Police, Mr. Babatunde Kokumo, who announced this while parading 11 suspects involved in various crimes in Benin City, said policemen at Ugbowo, who were immediately deployed to engage the robbers, shot one dead while others escaped.

“The command received a distress call about the activities of armed robbers at Evbuomore Quarters, Ugbowo, this morning. Policemen from Ugbowo and surrounding divisions were deployed to the scene to engage the robbers.
“In the ensuing gun battle, one of the marauders was shot dead while others escaped. Sadly, one Dr. Godwin Omofunwa, a lecturer in the Department of Education, UNIBEN, died as a result of gunshot wounds he received from the robbers. The deceased’s three phones and another Nokia phone stolen from one Precious were recovered from the dead robber,” Kokumo said.
He listed some of the items recovered from the other suspects on parade to include two cut-to-size guns, one single-barrel gun, one iron cutter, one live round and 12 expended cartridges and phones. The commissioner, while alleging misuse of policemen attached to VIPs in the state, directed all persons to whom policemen were deployed as escorts or guards to report to the police headquarters with letters of authority for verification.

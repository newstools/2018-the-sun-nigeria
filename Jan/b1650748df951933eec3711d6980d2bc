Tony John, Port Harcourt Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has declared that political leaders would be more accountable  if security agencies and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) restrict themselves  to their constitutional roles. Wike said that the use of security agencies and INEC by some politicians to manipulate  the electoral system has encouraged  them (politicians) to deny their constituents development projects. He spoke yesterday, during a courtesy visit by the Commander of the 115 Special Operations Group of the Nigerian Air Force, Air Commodore Elijah Ebiowe, to the Government House, Port Harcourt. Governor Wike said the only way the nation can make progress is when things are done correctly. He said: “The only way this  country  can grow is if things are done right. One of the reasons Nigerian leaders refuse to perform is because some of them connive with INEC and security agencies to rig. “Nobody cares, because whether or not you perform, they will use security agencies and INEC to manipulate the electoral process “. The governor noted that the State Government would continue to partner with the Nigerian Air Force for the promotion  of security,  adding that the  government would support the Nigerian Air Force to fight crime and criminality in the State. He warned the military against being dragged into the settlement of civil disputes. Earlier, the Commander of the 115 Special Operations Group of the Nigerian Air Force, Air Commodore  Ebiowe, assured the governor of the cooperation of the group in the maintenance of security. He informed the governor that he was recently posted to the State by the service to coordinate  the group  for the protection of the nation’s territorial integrity.

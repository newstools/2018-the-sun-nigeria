At the end of the encounter, six of the suspects were gunned down, while two policemen also sustained injuries..The injured policemen have been taken to the Hospital for medical attention. “Recovered from the suspects are, one double barreled shot gu, one single barreled long gun, several live and expended cartridges as well as assorted charms and cutlass”.

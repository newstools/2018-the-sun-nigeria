 Following the success of his ‘Engocentric mixtape’, which was released in 2016 on his birthday, the hip hop act known as Oluwasegun Clement Ezekiel aka Engo, has released a new song entitled, Omodele Reloaded, which is currently on massive rotation. “I am glad to inform my fans that following the success of my debut mix tape in 2016, I am out with a spanking new single entitled, Omodele Reloaded. My passion for music started at a tender age. Music for me is like oxygen because I was born into music. “My dad is a Shepherd of a Celestial Church while my mum is the choir mistress and all my sisters sing too. So, it’s more like I was raised in music,” he says, The indigene of Lagos State and graduate of Electrical Electronic Engineering from Ekiti State University adds: “The song encourages listeners to eschew discrimination in any form and advised up and coming artistes to remain focused and believe in themselves.”

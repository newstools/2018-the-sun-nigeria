The Inspector General of Police (IGP), Ibrahim Idris, has halted, temporarily, the withdrawal of policemen attached to Very Important Persons (VIPs) and political office holders, to enable the Force carry out assessment of its current personnel deployment. The IGP stated that the withdrawal would now take effect from April 20, 2018. Idris, in a statement issued by the police spokesman, Jimoh Moshood, in Abuja, yesterday, stated that the decision to suspend the withdrawal by one month was taken after a meeting with the Commanders of Police Mobile Force, Counter-Terrorism and Special Protection Units on Tuesday. “The IGP has directed the Deputy Inspector-General of Police, Operations, to direct all the Commissioners of Police and their supervising Assistant Inspectors-General of Police in the states and zonal commands to halt the withdrawal, revise and return those already withdrawn to their duty posts pending the new date of April 20, 2018,” the statement read. It added that the Task Force Teams set up by the IG at the Force Headquarters, the Force X – Squad and others set up by the AIGs and CPs, have equally been directed by Idris to suspend the enforcement of the withdrawal with immediate effect pending the new date. The police reiterated that “the public, political and political office holders, including VIPs and other categories of enterprises and corporate individuals and other entities, are to retain the police officers currently with them on deployment.” The Force also said those enjoying police protection may be provided personnel at the expiration of the period, from the Special Protection Unit and asked interested persons or organisations to apply for re-validation through the CPs of the states where they are resident before April 20.

Lionel Messi is set to miss Argentina’s second successive friendly after it was reported he would not feature in the Albiceleste’s clash with Spain at Atletico Madrid’s Wanda Metropolitano on Tuesday. According to British newspaper mirror.co.uk, Messi had been struggling for fitness since linking up with his international side before sitting as an unused substitute during Friday’s 2-0 friendly win against Italy at the Etihad Stadium. The forward had been complaining of discomfort in his hamstring and adductor in his right leg which had been attributed to fatigue from his gruelling season. He stayed in the hotel gym on Saturday, but did appear yesterday and went through his paces with the rest of the squad. The Barcelona star had played 47 times for club and country since the beginning of the season with nine La Liga, a Copa del Rey final, potentially five more Champions League fixtures before the 2018 World Cup.

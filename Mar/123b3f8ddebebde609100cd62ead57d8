Ighomuaye Lucky, Benin The Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN), on Tuesday, charged the Federal Government to use all in its capacity to effect the release of the last Dapchi School girl, Miss Leah Sharibu, from the captivity of the Boko Haram terrorists. The PFN in a press statement  by its National President, Rev. Dr. Felix Omobude, said the Federal Government must act urgently to free the only remaining Dapchi School girl unhurt. The Boko Haram terrorists last week freed over 100 Dapchi School girls abducted in February, this year and held back Leah for refusing to convert from Christianity to Islam. “What Leah Sharibu is going through has further confirmed our worries that the activities of the Boko Haram and killer herdsmen have religious undertone. These kinds of things should not be happening in a free and democratic nation like Nigeria. It is really unacceptable.

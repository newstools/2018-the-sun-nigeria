NAN Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was briefly hospitalised on Tuesday with a high fever, Israeli media reported. The 68-year-old was reportedly examined at Hadassah Medical Centre in Jerusalem and released late Tuesday. His official Twitter account said he had been diagnosed with a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract. A spokesman confirmed the illness while Ynet news site, citing his doctor, reported that Netanyahu hadnâ€™t taken enough time off to recover after suffering from a sore throat two weeks ago. Annual medical checks have generally given Netanyahu a clean bill of health, though he has undergone several minor medical procedures in recent years. In May he had a bladder stone removed and in 2014 had two small polyps removed from his large intestine. In 2013 he underwent a hernia operation. Netanyahu, his wife Sara and his son Yari were questioned over corruption allegations on Monday.

Chinenye Anuforo The CEO, mSurvey, a Kenya-based mobile-first consumer feedback platform, Dr. Kenfield Griffith, and other stakeholders from different multinational companies  have called on organisations to embrace the use of Net Promoter Score (NPS) to develop and boost their business. The stakeholders, who made the call at the just-concluded second Customer Loyalty NPS Masterclass at the Lagos Business School, organised by mSurvey, argued that, over the years, companies have developed many different methods for gauging the attitudes and behaviours of their customers to know their performance but the NPS is the most useful and practical method. NPS is a management tool that can be used to gauge the loyalty of a firm’s customer relationships. It serves as an alternative to traditional customer satisfaction research and claims to be correlated with revenue growth. This proven metric has transformed the business world and now provides the core measurement for customer experience management programs the world round. Griffith said that one important customer satisfaction metric is the NPS adding that it helps an organisation understand whether its customers would recommend it to others.

He stated that mSurvey would address the country’s data challenge by ensuring real-time customer feedback within a short period. According to him, the Safaricom-backed mSurvey would leverage the growing reach of mobile phones, by changing how data was collected from a time-consuming process to a real-time mobile conversation. On his part, Mr. Ken Kuguru, the CEO of Java House, said that his company was creating brands that were developed in Africa and for Africa adding that there was need for businesses to be customercentric for growth and survival. “We recognise that real-time feedback is important and the way to go, that is why we have keyed into it”, he said.

In a statement by the Special Assistant on Media to the Federal Commissioner, Halima Musa, quoted Farouq as saying, “On no account should humanitarian personnel be targets of any sort of attack.” She condoled with the United Nations, the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), and the Nigerian Government over the loss describing it as irreplaceable.

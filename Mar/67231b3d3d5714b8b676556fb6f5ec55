Paul Orude, Bauchi Bauchi State Government has received with deep shock the sudden death of Senator Ali Wakili representing Bauchi South and declared three days of mourning in his honour. In a condolence message, Governor Mohammed Abubakar  described Wakili’s death Saturday morning in Abuja as shocking “His passage is a great loss not only to his constituents but the entire nation. His vibrant contributions on the floor of the Senate chamber would be greatly missed. Such interventions have contributed in shaping national discourse,” said the message signed by the Governor’s special adviser on Media and Strategy. The message  added that the governor of Bauchi state “has, therefore, declared three days of mourning during which time flags will fly at half mast. He has also suspended all state duties in Abuja and is returning home to mourn after witnessing funeral prayers in the nation’s capital. “The governor has  similarly directed the reduction, by two hours, of closing time of workers during the three days of mourning. “The governor takes solace in the Quranic injunction that every soul shall taste death and, therefore, prayed for the repose of the soul of the departed legislator. He also prayed to ALMIGHTY ALLAH to grant the immediate family the fortitude to bear the loss,” it stated. ______________________ Original post Punch Lawmaker representing Bauchi South Senatorial District, Senator Ali Wakili, is feared dead.

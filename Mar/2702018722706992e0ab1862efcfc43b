Toks David, Lagos Vice President Yemi Osinbajo’s speech at the 7th Presidential Quarterly Business Forum in Abuja has been receiving a fair amount of notice and commentary, especially his point about what ails the Nigerian economy. The Forum, which took place Monday, March 19, at the Presidential Villa, is a consultative group consisting of public and private sector stakeholders who meet regularly to discuss the broad strokes of economic policy, projects and their implementation. Monday’s speech was notable for Osinbajo citing “Grant Corruption” as the single greatest flaw in what the Vice President calls an “abnormal economy”. Illustrating his point, the Vice President named instances in which large sums of public funds were routinely diverted by officials of the Jonathan administration, particularly during the 2015 general elections where, Osinbajo revealed, “in a few weeks to the elections… the sum of N100 billion and $289 million in cash were embezzled by a few.” Osinbajo’s statements and revelations have proven alarming as it drew attention to both the scale and degree of embezzlement previous governments have engaged in. Former President Goodluck Jonathan, whose administration Osinbajo’s speech made reference to in defining Grand Corruption, responded on Tuesday through a spokesman Reno Omokri, pushing back on the claims of the Vice President, and accusing him of spreading “slander and lies”. Omokri, in a scathing press statement, and in press interviews across major and social media, vehemently denied the characterisation of the Vice President regarding Jonathan’s administration. Osinbajo, in turn, has not reacted to the salvo of criticism from the past administration which are contained in its press release below:

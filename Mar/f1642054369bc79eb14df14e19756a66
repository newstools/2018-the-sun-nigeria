Manchester United teenage prospect, Tosin Kehinde, who recently pledged his allegiance to Nigeria ahead of England, will not honour coach Gernot Rohr invitation to train with the Super Eagles. His club, Manchester United, have kicked against the idea and the midfielder who now plays on the wings for the U23s of the Premier League giants in the Premier League 2 have been ordered back to Manchester. Man United pulled him out of training with the Super Eagles, as they need him to resume training today ahead of preparations for their Premier League 2 game on Tuesday, Owngoalnigeria.com can exclusively reveal. He would have been allowed to stay with the Nigerian team if he was formally invited but that wasn’t the case with the midfielder, hence he is back at the club training base to prepare for today’s game.

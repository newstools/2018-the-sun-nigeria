 Ethiopian Airlines General Manager in Nigeria, Mrs Firihewot Mekonnen, has disclosed that the airline is set to introduce the newest Boeing B787-900 aircraft into the Nigeria route. She said Ethiopian Airlines  has a high regard for the Nigerian market which was why it is always bringing in her newly acquired aircraft to the country to serve it’s customers.  She said in 2017, the airline was the first to introduce the Boeing 777 aircraft into the Nigerian market with an all female crew in a bid to encourage female Nigerians to take up carriers in the aviation industry. Mekonnen who decried the dominance of the Nigerian airspace over the years by European, Asian and American carriers, said she was impressed with a recent release by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority, (NCAA) which showed that Ethiopian Airline had beaten all the mega foreign airlines to emerge the leading carrier that air lifted the highest number of passengers in Nigeria in 2017. “This is the first time an African airline will be leading in the airlift of passengers in Nigeria, beating other big airlines from Europe, America and Asia and we are proud of this,” she said.

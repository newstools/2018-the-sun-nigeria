Samuel Bello, Abuja Former minister of environment, Ibrahim Jibril, says he would be handling over $170 million of the $180 million released by oil companies, N200 million and N5 million in the domiciliary account. He revealed this, on Wednesday, in Abuja, while handing over formally to the new minister of environment, Surveyor Suleiman Hassan Zarma. Jibril said, “The oil companies have made their pledge for this year by releasing 180 million dollars and I’m proud to say that I’m going to hand over to my successor 170 million dollars in the EXCO account and details will be sent in the handover. “He will see in the handover that there’s still a lot, about $5million, which is in the domiciliary account of the ministry and about N200 million in the Naira account.” It would be recalled that Jibril announced his resignation as the environment minister during Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting last week after which President Buhari appointed Zarma.

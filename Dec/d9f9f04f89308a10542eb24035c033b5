The RIA News Agency gave the indication on its report quoting   Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Friday. “If the U.S. really wants to come to some kind of agreement with us, then we need to sit down at the negotiating table in an inter-agency format and agree on everything in detail. “We are ready for this,” foreign ministry official Vladimir Yermakov was cited as saying.

It gave Moscow a deadline of 60 days or it would begin to withdraw from the pact. Yermakov also said Russia categorically ruled out inspections being carried out on Russia on a unilateral basis. According to Russia, any serious actions on arms control “are only possible on the basis of mutually legally binding inter-government agreements.” NAN

He charged Nigerians to vote based on the dividends of democracy as delivered by the current administration, adding, ‘‘If we return the APC into power, President Buhari will consolidate on the gains on ground. “I also advise voters to vote their conscience as many politicians from opposition parties have earmarked money to buy votes before and during elections.

As a politician, the governor said the late Fasehun’s argument for an egalitarian society where merit and equity are made parametric conditions for selecting leaders or people’s representatives will continue to dominate the socio-political discourse. Governor Akeredolu added that social scientists will remember the deceased as a detribalised Nigeria par excellence whose place in the nation’s political history cannot be wished away, even in a hurry.

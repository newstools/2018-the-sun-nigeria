NDDC on its part has just awarded 200 students in the Niger Delta region, scholarships for foreign studies. “This is also without forgetting that NDDC has embarked on massive renovation of public schools all over the Niger Delta region, while supplying desk and benches to them as well. “Several educational institutions just like Government College, Ughelli, have also been impacted through NDDC’s emergency repairs of failed and unmotorable sections of access roads. “Indeed, it was the famous Albert Einstein who noted that ‘I never teach my pupils, I only attempt to provide the conditions in which they learn.” While thanking  the organizers for the recognition, Adjogbe insisted that “every achievement of the NDDC is attributable to the mandate of President Muhammmadu Buhari for the Niger Delta region.” Mr. Cyril Ogude who presented the award, said it was in recognition of Adjogbe’s numerous contributions to the advancement of Government College, Ughelli.

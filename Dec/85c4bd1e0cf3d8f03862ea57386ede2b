NAN English Premier League clubside Southampton on Monday sacked Mark Hughes as manager, with the club mired in the relegation zone after only one victory this season. Hughes arrived at his former team in March on a short-term contract and helped the south coast club avoid relegation last season by securing a 17th place finish. The Welshman was handed a three-year deal in May, but has struggled to improve the team’s form this campaign.

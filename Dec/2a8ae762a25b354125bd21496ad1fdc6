Rose Ejembi, Makurdi No fewer than four persons were, on Monday night, reportedly killed during a clash between rival cult groups, in Makurdi, the Benue State capital. But the state’s Commissioner of Police, Ene Okon, said two persons were killed in the cult clash. Sources told Daily Sun that the incident occurred around 7:00p.m around Awe Street and Benue State Library, area of Wurukum. According to our source, who did not want to be named, the incident was said to have been sparked off by the killing of one of the rival cult members who just returned home from Abuja for his father’s burial ceremony. The Abuja returnee was said to have been shot right at the wake of his father which took place on Monday evening, while the attacker, a fifteen year old boy was chased and killed with stones around state library. Our source further disclosed that after the killing of the two persons, the two rival cult groups mobilised and their members started going after one other resulting to the deaths of additional two persons.

Tony Osauzo, Benin ‎In reaction to recent allegation of money laundering levelled against the President of the Nigeria Bar Association (NBA), Mr. Paul Usoro, the Benin branch of the association has called on all lawyers, irrespective of political leanings, to fight off what it termed ‘EFCC’s persecution and unwarranted intrusion’ into the practice of law and the legal profession. Chairman of the Benin branch of NBA, Prince Collins Ogiegbaen, who made call at the 2018 Young Lawyers Forum held in Benin-City, urged lawyers to choose professionalism over politics and stand with the NBA National President. Prince Ogiegbaen said the EFCC should not be allowed to extended unwarranted and unconstitutional jurisdiction over the contractual relationship that exist between a lawyer and his clients.

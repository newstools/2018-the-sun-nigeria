He also emphasised the need for practitioners to make theatrical productions that would help educate the masses on the need to eschew violence during elections. On his part, Mr. Omolulu Faniyi, Chairman, Ikorodu AD, said that AD remains the foundation of democracy in Lagos State but it was sad that the current leaders of the state have enslaved the people but when elected into office, AD will reinstate true democracy. Also speaking, a veteran Yoruba actor, Koran Kehinde Remi said LSTAAN rolled out the drums to support the governorship candidature of Salis because of his interest in developing the industry.

Rose Ejembi, Makurdi One man has been reportedly killed by suspected Fulani herdsmen in a settlement in Logo Local Government area of Benue State. It was gathered that the deceased, Mr Iorwuese Myaga, a father of seven, was until his gruesome murder, a resident of Anawah settlement in Ukemberagya Gaambe-Tiev, Logo LGA.

He left behind his wife and seven children,” Anawah stated. It was gathered that Ukemberagya settlement which has a population of about 300 people has been deserted following the attack even as residents are said to be taking refuge at an NKST church in Anyii town. When contacted, the state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Moses Yamu, said he was yet to be briefed on the matter and promised to get back to our correspondent as soon as he was briefed. But reacting swiftly, the Commander of Operation Whirl Stroke (OPWS), Gen. Yekini insisted that all parts of Benue celebrated Christmas peacefully without any problem. “The attention of OPWS has just been drawn to a story of the killing of a villager in Logo Local Government area by armed herdsmen on Christmas eve. “Please, note that the story is manifestly false and without any iota of truth in it. All parts of Benue State including Logo celebrated the Christmas peacefully without any killings recorded before, during or after the celebration. “You are kindly requested to please disseminate the above in your respective medium. “It’s apparent [that] some people are not happy with the current peaceful security situation in Benue and will go to any length to fabricate lies to cause unnecessary tension among the good people of Benue State. Nobody was killed in Benue please,” Yekini said.

According to him, the commission is looking forward to  the synergy that will be  unleashed  through teamwork, collaboration and sustainable partnership in  an atmosphere of peace and security. “The NDDC board and management have spent the last one year conceptualising and strategising on a roadmap and framework for sustainable regional development. “Now, we are stepping out of the room armed with ideas. And we are ready to run. “We need the partnership and collaboration of all stakeholders to make these happen. “As an intervention agency, our role is to resolve the developmental challenges of the region and support the development ambitions of the states by working together as partners. “Because this is our home and our region, we have no other place to go,” he said.

Nigerian international striker, Obafemi Martins has successfully undergone surgery on his ruptured quadriceps tendon. The Shanghai Shenhua forward sustained the injury in action for Shenhua in the Asian Champions League against Kashima Antlers, which ended 2-2 in midweek. He had gone under the knife in the United Kingdom and the club posted the development on Instagram with the player on the bed with his right leg strapped. “Martins had a successful surgery in UK,” the account wrote on Sunday. The injury ruled Martins out of a possible call-up to the Super Eagles for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia in June, as he would be out for up to seven months. Martins netted four goals in seven games in all competitions in the new Chinese Super League season before he got injured.

Robert Lewandowski scored his 39th goal of the season as Champions League semi-finalists Bayern Munich beat Hannover. Bayern, who host Real Madrid on Wednesday, have already wrapped up the Bundesliga title and started with some first-team regulars on the bench. Thomas Muller capped off a good move to score and fellow substitute Robert Lewandowski headed in, before Muller set up Sebastian Rudy’s late third. Lewandowski is now the top scoring foreigner for a single Bundesliga club. The Poland striker has scored 105 league goals for Bayern – taking him above Peruvian Claudio Pizarro’s tally for Werder Bremen. Elsewhere, Mark Uth scored twice as Hoffenheim won 5-2 at RB Leipzig to move above their opponents into fifth place. Hamburg kept alive their slim hopes of avoiding a first ever Bundesliga relegation by beating Freiburg 1-0 thanks to Lewis Holtby’s goal – however they remain five points below the relegation play-off place. On a high-scoring afternoon, Hertha Berlin won 3-0 at Eintracht Frankfurt and Stuttgart beat Werder Bremen 2-0.

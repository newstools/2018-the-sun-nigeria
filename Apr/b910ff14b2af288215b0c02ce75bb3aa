Founder of the Obi Ochije Foundation (OOF) and a chieftain of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Comrade Obi Ochije has condemned the invasion and snatching of the mace by suspected thugs in the Red Chamber, saying the act is barbaric, reckless and a sign of desperation by a few. In a release in Awka, Ochije said such could never happen in Anambra, as he called on all to emulate the quality leadership of Governor Willie Obiano in moving the state forward. He called on the country’s leadership to remember that what ever happens, the international community is watching. “In Nigeria, despicable act should not be happening when people are hungry, jobs disappearing by the minutes and the people living in fear. The government at the centre can no longer hold. They should allow those with the interest of the common man at heart to lead,” he said. Ochije called on the people to ensure they get their PVC and be ready to vote out leaders oppose to their interest. “If the rich refuse to take care of the poor, soon the poor will eat them,” he warned. He commended Governor Obiano for delivering democracy dividend to the grassroots, saying he is the kind of leader that Nigeria needs at the centre.

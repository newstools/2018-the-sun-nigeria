According to well known German magazine Der Spiegel, a woman from United States has launched a rape allegation against Juventus and Portugal football star Cristiano Ronaldo. Kathryn Mayorga, now 34, claimed that Ronaldo raped her in Las Vegas in 2009 and paid her $375,000 as hush money, reports Der Spiegel. The German magazine goes on to say that Mayorga’s lawyer is currently ‘questioning the validity of that out-of-court settlement in a civil complaint in Nevada’.

Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho has reportedly accepted a one-year suspended prison sentence for tax fraud in Spain. Mourinho is alleged to have defrauded the Spanish authorities of €1.9m (£1.78m) during his time in charge of Real Madrid, using offshore companies in Ireland, the British Virgin Islands and New Zealand to conceal his earnings. The Portuguese is thought to have earned around €3.3m (£2.9m) from image rights in 2011 and 2012, of which he has been fined 60%.

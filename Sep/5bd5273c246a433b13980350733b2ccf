Abdullahi, represented by his Special  Adviser on Media and Publicity, Muhammed Jamil Gulma, said “It comes to our notice that some elements are going round within the Kebbi North Senatorial with a recorded voice claiming to be the Senator’s voice telling the electorate that I (Senator Dr. Yahyah Abdullahi) is not contesting again for the seat come 2019 general elections which is not true and is an act of incapability. “Furthermore, I wish to inform the general public that Senator Dr. Yahyah has answered their call to maintain the seat, despite the dividend of democracy enjoyed by the people of Kebbi North through him, he is also one of the President Muhammadu Buhari’s henchmen who always have common man at heart. “Therefore, I am calling on the general public to disregard any kind of circulating rumours related to Senator Dr. Yahyah Abdullahi is not contesting again”.

NAN The Director of Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC), Prof. Ishaq Akintola, has urged the Federal Government to make the treatment of Malaria free. Akintola in a message on Monday to mark the Islamic New Year 1440 after the Hijrah, said the disease remained the highest killer of Nigerians especially the poor. He said that the government must also take the bold step of raising budgetary allocation to the health sector to enhance access to effective and efficient healthcare services by the poor. “The budgetary allocation to the health sector year after year falls short of the 15% recommended at the African Health Summit in Abuja more than ten years ago.

Akintola blamed the “pathetic” level of malaria cases in the country to corruption, greed and avarice which had whittled every effort to effectively tackle malaria prevalence. “Just one per cent of the Nigerian population arrogates 85% of the country’s wealth to themselves, leaving a paltry 15% of our wealth to the remaining 99% of the population. “Nigeria is a monumental tragedy when it comes to the distribution of wealth,” he added.

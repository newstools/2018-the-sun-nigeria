Real and Spain defender Sergio Ramos has come out to clear the air on his bizarre tackle on Reds’ Mohamed Salah in last season’s Champions League final in Kiev. Ramos, 32, who wore the armband for Spain against England at Wembley last night, said that he had never intended to hurt Salah who dislocated a shoulder in the incident after 25 minutes and later left the pitch in Kiev in tears. Jurgen Klopp later accused Ramos of flooring Salah “like a wrestler”. Asked about the potential reaction to him prior to the showdown at Wembley, Ramos said: READ ALSO Sarri vows: I’ll lead Chelsea to EPL title “I’m not really concerned about that.

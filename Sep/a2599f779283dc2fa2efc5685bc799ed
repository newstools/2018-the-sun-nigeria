NAN Tyler Adams scored in the 71st minute against 10-man Mexico, and the U.S. men’s national team defeated Mexico 1-0 on Tuesday at Nissan Stadium in Nashville, Tenn. Mexico’s Angel Zaldivar was sent off in the 67th minute after a hard challenge on U.S. Captain Wil Trapp of the Columbus Crew. Zaldivar went for a slide tackle, but instead put his studs into Trapp’s right leg. The Americans took advantage four minutes later. Defender Antonee Robinson, who plays for England’s Wigan Athletic, burst down the left flank and sent a cross to an onrushing Adams. The 19-year-old midfielder for the New York Red Bulls made a 35-yard run and smashed the ball at the penalty spot for his first international goal in his seventh game.

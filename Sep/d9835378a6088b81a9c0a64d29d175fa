NAN The Bayelsa Government has called for the support of community-based groups in sensitising the coastal communities in the state in order to check flooding. The state Commissioner for Environment, Mr Ebipatei Apaingolo, made the call on Thursday in Yenagoa, when a community-based group, Ondewari Health Education and Environmental Project (OHEEP) paid him a courtesy visit. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that the Nigeria Meteorological Agency (NiMET) recently predicted that Bayelsa was among the states to experience flooding this year. Apaingolo said sensitisation of the rural dwellers was necessary due to their ignorance and about the impending flooding. “In view of the impending flooding, the state government has concluded plans to embark on sensitisation tours of our coastal communities.

Earlier, the Director of OHEEP, Mr Alagoa Morris, intimated the commissioner of the rise in exploitation and harvest of forest resources including indiscriminate cutting down of trees in Bayelsa.

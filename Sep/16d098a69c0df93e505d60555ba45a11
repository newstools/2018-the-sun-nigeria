The states are: Kebbi, Niger, Kwara, Edo, Kogi, Anambra, Delta, Benue, Adamawa, Taraba, Rivers and Bayelsa. NEMA Director-General Mustapha Maihaja said the peculiarity of the listed states placed them on the list of those that require close watch and other emergency management agencies. He added that stakeholders have agreed that NEMA could activate its National Contingency Plan; which allows it to establish structures that will respond to emergencies. “The Plan gave NEMA the legal backing to activate five Emergency Operational Centers (EOCs), across Nigeria to professionally handle issues that, expectedly, would arise from the natural disaster. “EOC A will handle operations in Kebbi, Niger and Kwara States. EOC B will be in charge of Edo and Kogi States, and the EOC C will oversee operations in Anambra and Delta States. “EOC D will also oversee operations in Benue, Adamawa and Taraba States, while EOC E has been mandated to take care of operations in Rivers and Bayelsa States. NEMA headquarters will coordinate the entire operations,” Maihaja said. Last week, NEMA raised the alarm that water level at Confluence of River Niger and Benue, at Lokoja, had risen to significant 10.98 meters which were one of the signals that heralded the 2012 devastating flood across Nigeria. It also confirmed that the flood situation might get worst in some states in few days time with all indications and signals that Lagdo dam in Cameroon would be discharged soon.

Bamigbola Gbolagunte, Osogbo The governorship candidate of the Advanced Democratic Party (ADP), in Osun State, Alhaji Moshood Adeoti, has debunked rumours making the rounds that he has returned to the All Progressives Congress (APC). Adeoti came fourth in Saturday’s governorship election in the state which was declared inconclusive by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). There were rumours, on Wednesday, that Adeoti attended a meeting with some leaders of the APC in the state in a bid to return to the party. But, Adeoti who spoke through his media aide, Kayode Agbaje, denied attending any meeting with APC leaders in the state. He said, “We are not ready to leave the ADP for any other political party. Though there have been overtures by other political parties, we shall remain in ADP because we have our own action plan and ideology. “Alhaji Adeoti is a disciplined politician and the ADP has its own action plan different from that of the APC or any other political party.

Adeoti, a former Secretary to the State Government was the state chairman of the Alliance for Democracy (AD) when Governor Rauf Aregbesola contested the governorship election. He left the APC for ADP a few hours to the governorship primary election that produced Alhaji Gboyega Oyetola. Adeoti hinged his decision on his belief in the zoning of governorship position to Osun West senatorial district and his stand against direct primary system adopted by the party during its governorship primary election.

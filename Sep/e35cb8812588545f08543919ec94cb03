NAN Dr Micheal Ojo, Country Director, Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN), says that intake of poor quality diet remains the number one risk factor for ill health. Ojo stated this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Friday in Abuja. He noted that the quality of people’s diets depended on their food systems, right from when the food was grown to when it was eaten. “For many Nigerians, the daily contact with nutrition is only on food product labels. Teaching of Nutrition as a subject starts only in secondary schools and even at that, it is not compulsory. “No wonder the ability to make informed food choices in adulthood becomes a problem, the dietician said.

The dietician advised that food producers should not list out ingredients in quantities that the consumers would not understand, but should explain what each ingredient does to people’s wellbeing.

NAN Journalists in Somalia continue to face difficulties including death despite progress in defense of human rights, the UN has said. In a report, the UN Mission in Somalia said challenges remain for journalists and media workers, citing killings, harassment, arbitrary arrest and illegal detention. “In spite of some efforts and progress in the legislative field, regrettably violations and abuses concerning the right to freedom of expression continued to be recorded,” the UN secretary-general’s special representative for Somalia, Michael Keating, said at the report’s launch in the Somali capital.

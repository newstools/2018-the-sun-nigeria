Tony Udemba As the gale of defection continues to sweep across the country, over 1000 members of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in Ajeromi Ifelodun Local Government Area of Lagos State, have defected to the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, at an empowerment programme organized by the member representing Ajeromi/ Ifelodun Federal Constituency at the House of Representatives, Hon. Rita Odichimma Orji. Speaking while receiving the defectors at the playground of Saint Mary’s Catholic Church, Ajegunle, the lawmaker welcomed the APC members into the PDP fold and assured them of full integration into the activities of the party. She commended them for the courageous decision in dumping the APC. “The party has failed to deliver on its promises to Nigerians. It is clear, beyond any reasonable doubt that since the inception of the APC-led administration, the nation has continued to grapple with loads of socio-economic and political problems.

In her remarks, Mrs. Maina, a member of the PDP Board of Trustees (BOT), charged the defectors to be loyal to the party and to work in synergy with other members to ensure the victory of the party in coming elections. In his response, leader of the defectors and a former chieftain of APC in the area, Chief Tajudeen Balogun, said that they were forced to dump APC over inability “to implement its promises to bring the much talked about “change” to impact on the lives of Nigerians. Orji empowered over 230 youths and women in the area with sewing machines, fish drying machines, professional make-up tools, motorcycles, cars and other items.

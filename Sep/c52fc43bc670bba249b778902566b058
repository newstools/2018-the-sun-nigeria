NAN Ahead of the coming gubernatorial election in Osun , the Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC) has called on its personnel to show high level of commitment and professionalism by shunning corrupt and unethical standards before, during and after the election. Dr Boboye Oyeyemi, the FRSC Corps Marshal, who made the call during a visit to the Sector Command on Monday in Osogbo, charged the personnel to be apolitical. He said that 60 patrol vehicles, alongside both regular and special Marshals, would be deployed across the state, cautioning the officers against being used by politicians to disturb the electoral process. “We are deploying our men across the state, and I have cautioned them against being used by any political party. “The image of the corps is very important, and every officer must remain apolitical; knowing that the corps does not belong to any political party,” the corps marshal said.

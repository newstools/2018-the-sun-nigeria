Former governor of Abia State, Dr. Orji Kalu, has commiserated with Aare Ona Kakanfo of Yorubaland, Iba Ganiyu Adams, over the passing of his father, Pa Lamidi Adams. According to Kalu, regardless of age, the role of a father in a child’s life cannot be undermined.
In a statement signed by his Special Adviser, Kunle Oyewumi, Kalu urged the Aare to take solace in the fact that his late dad lived a remarkable life and left behind good virtues. “I sympathise with my brother and friend, Iba Ganiyu Adams and his siblings, over the demise of their father, Pa Lamidi Adams. Baba was a successful transporter, philanthropist and community leader. He lived a purposeful life and left behind good children to uphold his worthy attributes.” Kalu also prayed for the repose of the soul of Pa Adams.

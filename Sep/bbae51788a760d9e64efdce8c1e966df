A spokesman for Libya’s department to fight illegal migration denied migrants had escaped but the aid official working at an international organisation said as many as 1,800 might have left the facility located near airport road. NAN reports that on May 16, 100 east African migrants escaped from a camp in the Libyan town of Bani Walid where they were being held hostage and tortured, international agencies and local source said. The migrants from Eritrea, Ethiopia and Somalia fled to a mosque in the town where they were taken in by local associations and residents. The hospital in Bani Walid said around 20 of them were being treated for injuries from torture. According to Doctors Without Borders (MSF), in a statement quoting witnesses, 15 migrants were killed and 25 injured during the escape, but there was no immediate confirmation from local sources.

Bani Walid, 170 km southeast of the Libyan capital Tripoli, is a transit point for migrants aiming to reach Europe by boat from the coast further north. People traffickers and kidnappers run around 20 detention centres in the town, telephoning the migrants’ families to deliver ransom demands. Since the 2011 fall and killing of longtime dictator Moamer Kadhafi, Libya has become a key launchpad for migrants making desperate bids to reach Europe. The conflict-riven country is regularly singled out for the exploitation and ill-treatment of migrants from sub-Saharan Africa.

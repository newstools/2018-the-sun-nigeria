NAN The Governor of Benue, Samuel Ortom has declared that he would prefer to lose the next February governorship election than win it through violence.

Ortom said this  on Thursday at St Vincent De Paul Quasi Parish, Aliade, near the capital of Makurdi,  during a funeral mass for late Emmanuel Ayargwer, a retired magistrate. Ortom said it  is unnecessary to spill blood for any office because power belongs to God,  who gives it to whomever He wills. He said that the people of the state  are resolved in the implementation of the Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law 2017.

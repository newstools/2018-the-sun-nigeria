Chelsea winger, Victor Moses has set tongues wagging among fans of the English Premier League club, following his declaration that one of their top stars, Pedro is his ‘boy,’ which footballlive.ng gathered has sparked controversy at Stamford Bridge. While some of The Blues’ faithful take the expression to mean Moses and Pedro are close friends, a lot of cynics among them believe the Nigerian ace simply believes he is a better player than the former Barcelona icon. They are both wing players, but Moses excelled last season under The Blues’ former head coach, Antonio Conte, as a right-wing-back, while Pedro only saw a splash of action now and again, but the setting has since changed the other way round.

Unfortunately, for him, despite officially announced that he has retired from the Super Eagles, Moses is yet to regain his range with Chelsea, as he has missed action in their recent EPL matches. However, on being named to the squad for their UEFA Europa League clash against PAOK Saloniki of Greece, the former Crystal Palace and Wigan Athletic star took to social media to reveal a photograph of himself with Pedro. The photograph might not be infuriating in itself, but Moses posted along with it: “Team photo today and next to my boy Pedro.”

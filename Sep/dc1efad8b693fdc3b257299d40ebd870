Ortom also applauded the people of the state for the peaceful manner in which they conducted themselves during the polls. Rose Ejembi, Makurdi and Bamigbola Gbolagunte, Osogbo Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, described the Osun State election as a reflection of the resolve of Nigerians to reject impunity and give their mandate to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2019 elections. In a statement by his Chief Press Secretary (CPS), Terver Akase, he commended the PDP in Osun State for taking the lead in the election. Ortom also applauded the people of the state for the peaceful manner in which they conducted themselves during the polls. He urged them to sustain their support for the PDP and complete the good work they started in the supplementary election. Meanwhile, the Centre for Transparency Advocacy (CTA), an observer group, rated the election to be generally peaceful and successful. Its executive director, Dr. Chima Amadi, said at a press conference in Osogbo, yesterday, that though there were cases of vote buying in some polling centres, the election was successful. He rated the performances of the security agents that supervised the election high: “The election was successful in all the 30 local government areas. Some individuals were arrested for committing some electoral offences through the assistance of our observers.” He disclosed that a fake INEC presiding officer was arrested in Iwo, headquarters of Iwo Local Government by the police. Amadi said the suspect wore an INEC customized reflective jacket used for the 2014 governorship election. He said the suspect was handed over to the police by members of his group and he was later detained by the police.

Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford has signed a new six-year contract at Goodison Park. The Toffees signed Pickford from Sunderland before the start of the 2017-18 campaign, and the stopper has gone on to establish himself for the Merseyside outfit and England. Pickford was linked with a move away from the Toffees having helped the Three Lions to the World Cup semi-finals, but he has opted to commit his long-term future to his current team.

I want to play as many games as I can for the club, that’s my goal now.” Pickford has already made a total of 52 appearances for Everton in all competitions.

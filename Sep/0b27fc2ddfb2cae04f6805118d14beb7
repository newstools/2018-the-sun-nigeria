NAN Gov. Akinwunmi Ambode of Lagos State said on Tuesday that the state government was planning to develop a layout in a particular part of the city, to accommodate the corporate offices of professional associations. Ambode dropped the hint while receiving members of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN), led by its President, Alhaji Rasak Jaiyeola, in Alausa, Ikeja. The governor also said that his administration was committed to building an International Convention Centre in the state. He said that the infrastructure would not only be very useful economically, but also serve as an attraction point for tourism. Ambode, a fellow of the association, said that, already, his administration had partnered with an organisation to deliver the convention centre.

It makes sure that the card reader remain the only source of accreditation. “Once you do that, there is no need of incidence form; in 2015, the president was rigged in by virtue of incidence form and he still wants to benefit from that same method again. Every country is going electronic and Nigeria cannot be an exception “In 2014, it was the APC that was clamouring for card reader. When we debated extensively in the legislature, it was APC that practically stampeded us into using the card reader because INEC as it was then constituted had already planned a systematic way of rigging. They knew that they were going to have a card reader and later discarded it. “Prof. Jega blind-folded everybody into believing that he is the only straightforward chairman of INEC. He allowed incidence form to be used where he knew APC would win election and never allowed the rest of the country to use incidence form except card reader until later in the day when elections had been won and lost.”

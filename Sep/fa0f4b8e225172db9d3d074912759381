Laide Raheem,  Abeokuta Protest, on Tuesday, greeted the announcement of the All Progressives Congress (APC) consensus candidates for some elective positions by Governor Ibikunle Amosun of Ogun State as scores of youths stormed the Presidential Lodge venue of the exercise to protest alleged imposition by the governor. The consensus exercise which began, on Monday, and produced 23 House of Assembly candidates out of 26, was almost disrupted as the protesters, believed be to supporters of a House of Representatives aspirant for Abeokuta South Federal Constituency,  Afolabi Afuape, demanded that his name should be included in the consensus  list. The protesters, who were chanting the aspirant’s name, asked the governor not to drop Afuape, who is the Commissioner for Youths and Sport Development, for Lanre Edun, a former Chairman of Abeokuta South local government.

The ruling All Progressive Congress(APC) in Osun State has suffered another set back, as a serving lawmaker representing Odo-Otin State Constituency in the State House of Assembly, Olaoluwa Oyediran, dumped the party for the African Democratic Congress (ADC). The lawmaker, who defected to ADC at the weekend with hordes of his supporters in Okuku, Odo-Otin Local Government area of the state, decried the degradation the people of the state had suffered in the hands of APC. “APC has neglected and cheated the people of Osun without recourse to justice and equity. Any right thinking individual ought to uphold fairness which only African Democratic Congress(ADC), is ready to provide”, he said.

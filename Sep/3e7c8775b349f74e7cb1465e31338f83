Armed Anglophone separatists burned buses and blocked traffic into and out of the capital of the English-speaking northwest region, Cameroon’s military said yesterday, and it deployed additional troops. Separatists said the action in Bamenda was meant to disrupt next month’s presidential election as they say voting cannot take place in what they call the independent state of Ambazonia. The months of deadly unrest in Cameroon’s northwest and southwest pose a serious challenge to 85-year-old President Paul Biya, who has been in power since 1982 and is running again.

They were “ready to shoot at anyone who disrespected them so we were very scared,” he said. Another traveler, Philomena Ngwang, said they were threatened by a man with a “very, very large extravagant gun” and told to remove the colors representing Cameroon’s flag from their identity cards. Gen. Agha Robinson, who commands the troops in the northwest, said separatists seized road construction equipment to dig up roads and destroy buses before fleeing. “There is an operation to dislodge these terrorists to make sure weapons are seized,” Robinson said. At least 20 of the 70-seat buses were lined up in the nearby village of Akum yesterday, with some of their roofs smashed in by the heavy equipment, as military personnel helped the scattered travelers track down their luggage.

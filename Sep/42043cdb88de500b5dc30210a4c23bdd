Leicester City have announced that Harry Maguire has put pen to paper on a new five-year contract. Maguire, 25, joined Leicester from Hull City in the summer of 2017, and impressed for the Foxes during the 2017-18 campaign before playing a key role in England’s charge to the semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup. Manchester United were strongly linked with Maguire during the summer transfer window, but Leicester ultimately refused to sell the central defender.

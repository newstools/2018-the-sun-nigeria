According to the former Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) stalwart, “The Federal Republic of Nigeria must be restructured to reflect the characteristics of a well-organised federation; a federation that has the core function of the federating unit. “We need to devolve power to the various federating unit so that we can live together in peace. “I believe that the SDP is a concerned party of the conditions of the nation and the situation of the people. “We will bring out Nigeria from the woods and move forward to development. “Another issue is infrastructure which is a priority. Any nation that must develop must have excellent infrastructure in terms of good roads, railways, waterways, airways so that goods and servicescan move. Nigeria has mediocre eeconomy we must give Nigeria 21st infrastructure. Every economy that is vibrant in the world depends on excellent infrastructure,” he added.

Mansur told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that inadequate preparations would always result in failure. He said that national teams should be exposed to international friendlies aimed at bringing out the best in them. “It is unfortunate that many of our teams don’t even play friendlies with renowned and international teams before going to international competitions.

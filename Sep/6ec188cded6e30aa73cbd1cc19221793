He added that two suspects are in custody and thorough investigation is ongoing. He praised the doggedness and preparedness of officers and affirmed that the Unit under his watch will nip the affairs of smugglers in the bud. Speaking further, he queried the aim of the importers of the consignment in concealing the military hardware and medicament explaining that the improper importation of the camouflage and medicament poses grave health and safety risks. He urged smugglers to engage in legitimate trade and called for public support in the fight against smuggling. On the vehicles, the Comptroller said the bulletproof ones were not accompanied with relevant documents and the appropriate permit from the National Security Adviser prior to importation, hence the seizure. He advised importers of such cars to pay the appropriate duties and resist the lure of evasion. “Most of these vehicles are worth millions of naira. If they can afford to buy these vehicles, they should not evade paying the duty,” he said. He assured that the Unit’s anti-smuggling operations will not relent under his watch and that the antics of smugglers will be thwarted in the zone. He also urged importers to acquaint themselves with extant laws governing trade in the country to avoid running afoul of the them. Displaying some of the rice seizures, Comptroller Olusemire gave details of a consignment of rice concealed underneath heaps of bananas in a truck. He explained that officers were not in habit of hindering local traders in their daily business. However, the officers, acting on a tip off, checked the vehicle and discovered the infraction.  He sternly warned smugglers to quit the nefarious business, even as he urged Nigerians to support the local agricultural industry and buy locally produced rice. He further stated that the ban of rice importation through land borders was still in force and urged the public to boost the agriculture sector and the economy patronising locally produced goods. “With inter-agency cooperation, the support of the media and the public, we are positive that smuggling will be brought to a bare minimum,” he noted.

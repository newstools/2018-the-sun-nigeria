The final of the African Nations Championship (CHAN), holding in Morocco, will be broadcast live on DStv and GOtv from 8pm on Sunday. The match will see the home-based Super Eagles play hosts, Morocco, at the Stade Mohammed V. Nigeria face the Atlas Lions, who breezed their way through the group stages, thrashing Mauritania by four goals in the tournamentâ€™s opening fixture, beating Guinea 3-1 and ending the group stages with a goalless draw against Sudan. They then beat Namibia 2-0 in the quarterfinals and edged past Libya 3-1 in the semi-finals. They will have the benefit of vociferous home support. The home-based Super Eagles have not been as imperious. They drew with Rwanda before beating Libya and Equatorial Guinea in the group stages. They required extra-time to get past Angola 2-1 in the quarter-finals and scraped past Sudan 1-0 in the semis in a match they played with numerical disadvantage for over 30 minutes, following the dismissal Ifaenyi Ifaenyi for a second caution in the 58th minute.

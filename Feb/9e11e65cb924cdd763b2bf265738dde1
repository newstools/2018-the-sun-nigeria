Bimbola Oyesola Workers in the aviation sector yesterday shut down the operations of the Bristow Helicopters and Caverton Helicopters nationwide alleging  expatriate quota abuse and gross violation of workers rights. The workers under the National Association of Aircraft Pilots and Engineers (NAAPE) and the Association of Aviation Professionals (ANAP), said the protest was in reaction to the refusal of their management to address issues bordering on the welfare of their members. The unions supported by other affilates in the United Labour Congress (ULC) blocked the entrance and exit gates of Bristow Helicopters in Lagos and Port-harcourt as early as 7 a.m to prevent passengers and others customers of the firm from gaining access. Members of the unions in the two helicopter companies had withdrawn their services, including the supply of fuel until issues raised by the unions are equitably resolved. At the General Aviation Terminal (GAT), wing of the Lagos Airport, scores of union members who besieged the company were seen singing solidarity songs and dancing to music blaring from loud speakers. Several union members expressed disenchantment over the way  the management of Bristow Helicopters maltreats and humiliate its Nigerian workers. They displayed placards with inscriptions,  “Racism in Bristow must stop”, “Nigerian Jobs for Nigerians”, “We say no to forced labour in Bristow”, “Stop abusing and violating our rights and privileges “ to drive home the maltreatment of Nigerian workers by the helicopter company.

They seem to have forgotten where they are coming from and how they started. For us, it is not our culture to disrespect our elders and those that nurtured and brought us to lime light. We love justice, equity and fair play and we cannot afford to do this evil against our brothers from other zones. This is the turn of Owerri zone and it is unquestionable. There is no controversy about this,” he submitted.

Timothy Olanrewaju, Maiduguri The Nigerian Army has dismissed a video purportedly released by Boko Haram showing the gruesome killing of scores of soldiers at a military base in Borno State last weekend. Army Headquarters, in its first reaction to last weekend’s attack on a military base at Metele, Guzamala Local Government Area of Borno State, contained in a press release on its official web, said the video was part of the propaganda of the terrorist group to “misinform the populace and portray themselves as what they are not.” “The spurious circulation of some of these videos only contribute to further propagate the propaganda intent of the terrorists; to misinform the populace and portray themselves as what they are not. So far, the situation is that the location is under control as reinforcing units have been able to repel the terrorists and stabilise the situation,” the Army said.

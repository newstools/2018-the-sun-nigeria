Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has described the alleged participation of Service Chiefs at the President Muhammadu Buhari’s  “Next Level” campaign launch, on Sunday, as completely unacceptable. The PDP, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, yesterday, said the participation of the military chiefs sends wrong signal to the public, regarding the expected professionalism, neutrality and detachment of the military from partisan politics. The opposition party said it believes in the professionalism of the military, and, as such, insisted that the professionalism of the armed offices must not be eroded. Consequently, the party urged the military high command to be wary of the alleged moves by the Presidency to compromise the armed forces.

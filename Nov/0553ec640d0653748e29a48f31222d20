Adewale Sanyaolu Traders at the popular Bodija and Oje markets in Oyo State have begged the Federal Government to make more funds available for them  under the TraderMoni initiative. The TraderMoni scheme which is being implemented under the Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme (GEEP)  is aimed at empowering two million traders. A pepper seller in Bodija market, Monsurat Ajadi, who applauded the government GEEP initiative, however, demanded  more funds should be made available under the scheme to support petty traders.

She said she was a benecificary of the scheme and promised to make judicious use of it to better her trade. “ I am calling on the Federal Government to make additional funds available to petty traders in a bid to better their lots as making more funds available would go a long way in empowering traders and lifting them above the poverty line,” Aweni said. Leading a delegation of the Federal Government to the two markets, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, said the government was sincere about empowering two million traders through the scheme, assuring that more traders would be captured nationwide under the scheme. He stressed that the policy of the Federal Government is not just to support big businesses but also small, medium-sized and micro businesses. Osinbajo appealed to those yet to benefit from the exercise to be patient  just as he charged those who have benefited to use it judiciously. About 27, 000 traders in Gbagi International Market Ibadan, Oyo State had over a month ago benefited from the Federal Government’s TraderMoni to grow their socioeconomic activities across Nigeria. The GEEP scheme is managed and financed by the Bank of Industry (BoI) on behalf of the Federal Government.

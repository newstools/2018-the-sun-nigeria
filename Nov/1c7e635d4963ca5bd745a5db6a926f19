Ojo decried the manner at which cases of the inmates were being handled and advised prison officials not to unjustly delay cases. She appealed to prison officials to always take inmates to court for their trials rather than keeping them behind bars for unjust reasons. Mr Mathew Ajagun, the officer-in-charge of Ile-Ife prisons, commended the Chief Judge and others officials that graced the occasion for her kindness gesture, as the exercise served as a measure to decongest Ile-Ife prison. He added that releasing the inmates would give the prison sanity, assuring them that the inmates would turn a new leaf and be good citizens. According to him, 377 inmates were presently in the prison, with 325 awaiting trials, while 52 were convicts.

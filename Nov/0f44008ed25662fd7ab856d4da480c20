NAN Russia said it deployed its new frigate with long-range Kalibr cruise missiles to the Mediterranean Sea on Monday. The vessel will be acting in the standing naval force of the Russian fleet in the Mediterranean,” the Russian Defence Ministry said in statement. The ministry did not, however, say whether the frigate was supposed to take part in the military operation in Syria. Moscow has backed President Bashar al-Assad since entering the war in 2015. The deployment came a few months after Moscow had  reinforced its naval forces off Syrian coast. “The Black Sea Navy Fleet’s frigate Admiral Makarov left (Navy base) Sevastopol and laid a course for the Black Sea straits. Russia has in the past fired Kalibr cruise missiles from frigates and submarines stationed in the Mediterranean Sea at militant targets to support Syrian army offensives.

There’s claims Alexis Sanchez turned on his teammates after Manchester United’s defeat at Manchester City. The Chilean was instead left on the bench alongside Romelu Lukaku and £50million summer signing Fred, before coming on twenty minutes before the end. The Sun says after the match Sanchez returned to the changing room with the rest of his team and made his anger at not starting known.

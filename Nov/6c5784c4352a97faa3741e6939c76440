NAN Atletico Madrid threw away the chance to go top of the Spanish La Liga o Saturday by conceding a late equaliser to draw 1-1 away to neighbours Leganes. The result ensured their miserable run at the Madrid minnows dragged on. France forward Antoine Griezmann had given Diego Simeone’s side the lead with a sizzling free-kick in the 69th minute in a typically tight game at the Butarque stadium.

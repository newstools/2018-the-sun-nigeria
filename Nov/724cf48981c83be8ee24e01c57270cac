Twelve people including a pilot on Thursday were injured after a helicopter crash-landed in the Philippines’ Tarlac province, north of Manila, an Army general said. Lt.-Gen. Emmanuel Salamat, commander of the military’s Northern Luzon Command, said the accident happened at around 2:00 p.m. local time when the Philippine Air Force Sokol helicopter crash-landed at Col. Ernesto Ravina Air Base, also known as Crow Valley.

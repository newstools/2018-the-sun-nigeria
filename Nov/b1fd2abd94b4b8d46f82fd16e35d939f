The Football Association is appealing against the decision by an independent regulatory commission to clear Jose Mourinho of using foul language at the end of Manchester United’s Premier League match against Newcastle. After coming back to win 3-2 to a backdrop of intense scrutiny about the Portuguese’s Old Trafford future, the 55-year-old manager was filmed in animated mood. Footage showed Mourinho making comments in Portuguese, at one point looking into a camera, as he headed towards the tunnel after the final whistle on October 6, leading to an FA charge for using abusive, insulting or improper language.

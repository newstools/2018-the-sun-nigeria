Rose Ejembi, Makurdi Vice Chancellor, Federal University of Agriculture, Makurdi (FUAM), Prof. Richard Kimbir, has lamented the continued illegal encroachment of the institution’s land by some persons. Prof. Kimbir stated this while briefing newsmen, on Wednesday. He blamed the encroachment on the absence of perimeter fence to demarcate and safe guard the university land. He noted that his administration was finding it difficult to check trespassers on the land as their activities have continued to embarrass and frustrate developmental projects in the institution. The Vice Chancellor said it was for this reason that his administration has constituted committees whose findings may help check the challenge.

NAN The Senate on Tuesday suspended the confirmation of Olanipekun Olukoyede as Secretary to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). This followed Sen. Isah Misau’s (APC-Bauchi) objection to the report of the Committee on Anti-Corruption and Financial Crimes on the screening at plenary. Misau, who is a member of the committee, stated that he did not append his signature to clear the nominee for confirmation. He claimed he was not invited to the screening exercise; hence it was wrong for the clerk of the committee to release a report not consented to by all committee members. “I am a member of this committee and I was not invited to the screening. “I am calling on you, Mr President, to step down this confirmation because I remember I raised objection in one of the meetings and this one is very sensitive,” he said. Sen. Chukwuka Utazi, the Chairman of the Committee on Anti-corruption and Financial Crimes, had while presenting the committee’s report, said Misau was invited to the screening.

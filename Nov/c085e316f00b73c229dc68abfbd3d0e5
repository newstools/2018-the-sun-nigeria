NAN The Enugu State Police Command has advised secondary school students against peer pressure that could lead them to becoming members of cult groups. The command’s spokesperson, SP Ebere Amaraizu, gave the advice on Friday while addressing students of Coal Camp Secondary School, Ogbete, Enugu, at their assembly hall. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the advice came as part of an ongoing statewide Police Campaign Against Cultism and other Social Vices (POCACOV). According to Amaraizu, students largely claim they become cultists because of peer group influence, desire to be famous and to gain protection, among other reasons.

He also advised the students to try as much as possible to know who they make friends with. “You must know your friend and what your friend is up to. “You must also be able to resist any pressure to lure you into becoming a member of any cult group. “Do well to quickly report such pressure or threat to your parents, guardians and teachers for prompt and necessary action. “This is because the consequences of being a cultist include death, rustication from school, interrupted education, jail, life-threatening injuries, among others,’’ said the police spokesman. NAN reports that some of the students said that the sensitisation had brought them closer to the police, as well as educated them on things that could lead them into negative tendencies.

The Supreme Court has refused to grant permission to the Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers State, Mr Ojukaye Flag-Amachree, to travel for a medical appointment in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates. The court, in its ruling, ordered the accused person to answer to the charges against him, and observed that he has not taken his plead up till date, after 25 adjournments; due to his refusal to appear in court. Flag-Amachree will face prosecution over allegation of murder of a man during the 2015 election in Asari-Toru Local Government area of the state. He was refused bail on May 26, 2016, by a High Court sitting in Port Harcourt, but, on November 24, 2016, the Court of Appeal granted him bail. The apex court has, however, barred him from travelling; in a ruling delivered by Justice Inyang Okoro, following an application for leave to travel filed by the APC chieftain. In the motion, Amachree sought an order of the court, granting him to leave for Dubai, where he will meet up with a scheduled medical appointment. He also sought the order of the court for the release of his travel documents to enable him undertake the trip.

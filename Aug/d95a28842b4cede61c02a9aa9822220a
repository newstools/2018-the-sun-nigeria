Already, the level of water in the river, as at Thursday, 30th August, is estimated to be 8.84m, a level that is higher than the 2012 level of 8.62 metres,” the NOA said. The Agency further said states likely to be affected, according to the NIHSA’s Director of Engineering Hydrology, Clement Nze, are Kogi, Kebbi, Anambra, Bayelsa, Niger, Kwara and Delta. It said as a proactive measure, NOA Director-General, Dr. Garba Abari, has directed the Agency’s Directorates in the affected states to immediately commence, in partnership with other relevant agencies and organisations, the sensitisation of citizens on the situation to avert the effect of flooding in these areas. “The campaign will emphasise the need for citizens to be environmentally responsible by clearing water channels, while admonishing those living or doing business along the coastal areas to move upland to avert danger,” the NOA added.

Wilfried Zaha has penned a new five-year contract at Crystal Palace worth £130,000 per week, making him the highest-paid player at the club. It comes after Palace staved off strong interest from both Tottenham and Chelsea, who couldn’t stump up the £70million it would have taken to prise him away from Selhurst Park. But amid the furore surrounding his future, Zaha has repeatedly reaffirmed his commitment to Palace and has been rewarded with a bumper new deal.

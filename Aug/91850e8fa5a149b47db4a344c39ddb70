Footballing legend Diego Maradona had a “rampant sexual encounter” with Inter Milan captain Mauro Icardi’s stunning WAG Wanda Nara. The alleged romp took place at the Costa Galana Hotel in the city of Mar del Plata in the Argentinian province of Buenos Aires in 2006 – and was so loud it kept people up. Argentinian TV star Mirtha Legrand says she heard Diego Maradona and Nara making love and they were so noisy she could not sleep.

She said ‘Why don’t you invite me onto your programme?’ “I responded ‘You? Who went out with Maradona? Last night you didn’t let me sleep.’ I was in the presidential suite, next to them and I couldn’t sleep because of the noise. “They moved furniture, I don’t know what they were doing. This is the truth. I was an auditory witness to their rampant sexual encounter.” Nara has a history with Argentinian footballers, having been married to former Barcelona player Maxi Lopez before divorcing him and marrying his friend and former Sampdoria teammate Mauro Icardi. Lopez had taken Icardi, 23, under his wing and was somewhat of a role model for him during his younger days. But when Lopez’s marriage to Wanda fell apart, he was soon stabbed in the back by Icardi. The 31-year-old model has reportedly said she “hated” footballing legend Maradona, 57. She was 18 at the time of the alleged night she spent with Maradona. Nara and Inter Milan captain Icardi have been married for four years and the couple have two daughters together.

He also suspended the collection of revenues by local government authorities till further notice. Umahi, who announced the suspension yesterday, during a town hall meeting in Abakaliki, also suspended the collection of other illegal revenues from all markets in the state. The governor’s action came following complaints from market women, through their leader, Mrs. Akoji Agnes, concerning alleged illegal revenue collection. Umahi, while reacting to the development, directed that the suspension takes immediate effect. He also directed that no levy or tax should be collected from women selling vegetables and other perishables in the open market.

He regretted that some unscrupulous elements had capitalised on the ignorance of the people on the harmonised consolidated revenue to defraud traders and landlords in the state. The governor directed his deputy, Dr. Kelechi Igwe, to set up a committee on revenue to hold a meeting with relevant stakeholders, including market women, traders, council chairmen, traditional rulers and others, to come up with acceptable revenue which they are to pay.

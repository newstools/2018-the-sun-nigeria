Gyang Bere, Jos Senator representing Plateau South and former minister of Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Gen. Jeremiah Useni (rtd) has expressed his determination to fix Plateau State if elected governor. He noted that despite his age, he is prepared mentally and intellectually to be governor for a single term with the sole aim of fixing the security and economy of the state for the prosperity of the people. Speaking in an interview with Daily Sun in Jos, Useni expressed disappointment in the leadership of Governor Simon Lalong, who he claimed had failed to secure lives and property in the state. “What is happening in Plateau now is so frustrating and something urgent need to be done; and one way I can contribute properly is to go into the governorship that will give me the opportunity to work with the people, I am not going to work alone.

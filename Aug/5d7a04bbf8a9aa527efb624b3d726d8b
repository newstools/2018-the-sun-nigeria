Joe Apu A man believed to be a member of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Victor Ikechukwu Ugwu, has allegedly gone into hiding for fear of prosecution and threat to his life in his participation in a protest in the South East part of Nigeria sometime ago, the family has said. Ugwu, it was gathered, went into hiding after he learnt from close sources that he was on the wanted list of security agencies. According a family source, who does not want to be named for security reasons, Ugwu was last seen on July 15, 2018 and though he communicates once a while, they are bothered about his safety given the fate other IPOB members have suffered in the past.

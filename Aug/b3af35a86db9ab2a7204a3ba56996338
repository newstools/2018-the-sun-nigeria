Femi Folaranmi, Yenagoa The Ogbia Restoration Crusaders (ORC), has described as “completely false” claims of Governor Henry Seriake Dickson endorsing politicians from Ogbia Local Government Area for various political offices in 2019. The organisation therefore warned those it referred to as “mischievous politicians” especially those jostling for the ticket of the PDP, to desist from using the name of the governor to curry favour from prospective delegates and demoralise more competent and acceptable aspirants. The Director General of the ORC, Okaniba Damson in a statement said that the endorsement propaganda was intended to cause confusion among loyal members of the Peoples Democratic Party in the area adding that Dickson has not endorsed anyone and will not do so because of his democratic nature of allowing the people to decide their representatives. The group recalled that Dickson had in different fora, emphatically stated that only the most popular candidate who reflects the interest and wishes of his people will be allowed to fly the party’s flag.

Romanus Ugwu, Abuja The All Progressives Congress (APC), National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, has sworn in Daniel Madueke Nwafor, as the new Imo state chairman of the ruling party. The party defied the court injunction obtained by a faction in the Imo State APC dispute to swear in the new chairman. Speaking shortly after administering the oath of office to the new state chairman, Oshiomhole charged him to do everything possible to ensure that all members irrespective of which side they belong are carried along in the operations of the party. He promised that the national leadership would work with Governor Rochas Okorocha to ensure that varied interests are also integrated into the new party structure so that the party can operate as one family ahead the 2019 general elections.

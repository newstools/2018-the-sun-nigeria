The Speaker said that one of the drawbacks in the system was prevalent cases of abuse of human rights. According to him, if the rule of law is followed to the letter, the nation’s democracy will bring more merits than what the nation is currently witnessing. “Let everybody follow the rule of law so that we can have a law-abiding society. A situation where some Nigerians will not abide with the written Constitution should be stopped,” he said. Ahmad condemned Tuesday’s blockade of the National Assembly by operatives of Department of State Services (DSS), saying it was unconstitutional. He said that the infraction needed serious sanction on everybody involved. He commended the acting President, Prof. Yemi Osibajo, for his prompt action in checking the incident.

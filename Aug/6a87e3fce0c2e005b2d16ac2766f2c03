He said: “Many drugs in Nigeria are imported and that should not be so. When we talk about fake drugs, we can avoid it if we try to produce locally here. We want the executive order to become a law and we want Nigerians to understand that many laws are broken, but if Nigerians can know the importance of this order, it would go a long way. In his address, NAPA National Chairman, Martins Emeje, said a nationally coordinated action is needed to preserve natural resources for current and future generations, finding solutions for degrading societies and preparing cities for the next century. “We are currently confronted with major problems resulting from the unbridled importation of medicines, the quality of which we cannot vouch for; fundamental to this anomaly is the total absence of local and indigenous drug production,” he said.

Liverpool winger, Sheyi Ojo could join Stade Reims on loan for the rest of the season, according to Sky sources. The French side had expressed interest in a loan deal for the 21-year-old, although nothing had been agreed ahead of the European transfer deadline on Friday. It was also thought that Ojo, who had made 13 appearances for Liverpool since emerging from the club’s academy in 2015, was keen to make the move.

Sky Bet Championship side, Aston Villa was said to be interested in loaning Ojo earlier in the transfer window, but had since signed an alternative option in Yannick Bolasie. Having secured promotion to Ligue 1 last season, Stade Reims made a strong start to life in France’s top division, winning two of their opening three matches.

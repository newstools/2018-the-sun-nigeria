NAN Vietnam has ordered Police and Military forces in the Capital, Hanoi, to prevent big gatherings or protests during its National Day holiday by September, the Hanoi People’s Committee said on Monday. Freedom of assembly is legal in the Communist-ruled country, but despite sweeping reforms, communist-ruled Vietnam tolerates little dissent. Protesters and activists are often prevented from gathering or charged with “causing public disorder’’. “ (The authorities) should closely monitor and take efficient measures to prevent people from gathering and protesting in the city,” Hanoi chairman Nguyen Duc Chung said in a statement on the Hanoi People’s Committee website. Police and military officials should step up security and safety measures at cultural and entertainment sites before, during and after National Day on Sept. 2, Chung said. The committee did not say what issues it thought might lead to protests.

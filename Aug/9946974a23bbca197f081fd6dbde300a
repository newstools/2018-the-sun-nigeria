Manchester United have reportedly agreed personal terms with Barcelona centre-back Yerry Mina. United boss Jose Mourinho is keen to bring a new central defender to Old Trafford ahead of the 2018-19 campaign, but has been frustrated in his pursuit of Tottenham Hotspur’s Toby Alderweireld and Leicester City’s Harry Maguire. Mina has been strongly linked with a move to the 20-time English champions in recent days, and it is understood that the defender has already agreed personal terms over a move to Manchester.

His legacy as a presidential candidate of the U.S. Republican Party and as a prisoner of war whose resilience remained unbroken while captured in Vietnam for five years, is a reminder to all of us that the interests of our respective nations must always prevail over our individual interests. He will be missed,” Saraki stated. The Senate President condoled with the United States Government and its Senate, saying that “McCain inspired all of us.”

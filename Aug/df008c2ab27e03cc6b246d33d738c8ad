Romanus Ugwu, Abuja The All Progressives Congress (APC), has expressed anger against the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), over the leakage of sensitive official correspondence between the ruling party and the Commission on the timetable for the party’s primaries for 2019 general elections. The ruling party had continually denied the report trending that it has fixed its presidential primary for September 19 and other local and national primaries, but the correspondence with the Commission confirmed the timetable. Reacting to the leaked correspondence in a statement entitled “Re: Leaked Notice for APC Congresses, Primaries For 2019 Elections”, signed by the acting National Publicity Secretary, Yekini Nabena, the ruling party condemned it in the strongest terms.

Atletico Madrid fans are furious with Thibaut Courtois’ move to Real Madrid. Atletico supporters hit out at Courtois yesterday following his £35million move to Real from Chelsea, having previously spent three seasons on loan with Atletico. The goalkeeper shouted insults about Madrid fans following Atletico’s Copa del Rey success in 2013 and cemented himself as a fan favourite before returning to parent club, Chelsea.

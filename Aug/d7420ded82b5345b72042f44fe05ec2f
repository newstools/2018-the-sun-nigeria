NAN The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has promised to fish out, soon, perpetrators of multiple registration in Adamawa for prosecution. Mr Kasim Gaidam, the Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in the state, gave  the promise in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Yola on Friday. Gaidam expressed worry over multiple registration by some people in the state, adding that such development would not be allowed to continue. “As the last minute for the suspension of the Continuous Voters Registration (CVR)  approaches, the commission has noticed multiple registration in the state.

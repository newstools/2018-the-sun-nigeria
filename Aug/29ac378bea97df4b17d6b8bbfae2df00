Also speaking at the gathering, an aspirant for the seat representing Kazaure/Roni/Yankwashi/ Gwiwa Federal constituency, Alhaji Kabiru Muhammed Roni, commended the courage and wisdom exhibited by the defectors for dumping the PDP. Alhaji Roni who is the key player in wooing the defectors in to the APC, promised to carry the new members along, work with them towards the victory of the party in the state and nation at large. Speaking on behalf of the defectors who came from across the seven political wards of the locality, Malam Isa Naradi said, they dumped the PDP for the APC in recognition of exemplary leadership demonstrated by Governor Muhammadu Badaru in the state, and also to support the candidature of Alhaji Kabiru Muhammed who they described as a man of integrity and trust worthy.

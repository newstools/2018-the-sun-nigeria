Cristiano Ronaldo scored within eight minutes of his Juventus debut in the traditional friendly against the youth team, while Paulo Dybala got a brace. The pre-season match is always hosted by the tiny town of Villar Perosa, which was invaded by around 15,000 fans today eager to get a look at the new signings. Above all, it was the first appearance in a Bianconeri jersey for Ballon d’Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo, who missed the tour of North America so he could fully recover from the World Cup. Coach Max Allegri unveiled an all-attack formation with Juan Cuadrado at right-back, returning Leonardo Bonucci in defence, Emre Can and Rodrigo Bentancur in midfield. Federico Bernardeschi, Paulo Dybala and Douglas Costa fanned out behind centre-forward CR7.

Inevitably, Cristiano Ronaldo scored the first goal, as he controlled a long ball over the top from Bernardeschi and blasted it past the goalkeeper one-on-one. CR7 attempted an overhead kick too, but when trying to prevent a Ronaldo tap-in, Cappellini accidentally put through his own net. Douglas Costa’s solo attempt hit the inside of the upright again before vice-captain Paulo Dybala’s header on the Brazilian’s cross. Dybala missed a sitter, but then was in the right place to meet the rebound after a save on Ronaldo. After wholesale changes at half-time, veteran Claudio Marchisio finished a team move with a low drive on Sami Khedira’s cut-back. This friendly always ends with a pitch invasion by the fans, so very rarely reaches 90 minutes, and this time managed around 75 minutes.

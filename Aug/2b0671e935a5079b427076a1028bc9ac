Over time, Adaeze proved her keen ability to make a profit and to manage the most hysterical situations. However, when her father falls ill, both she and her rival were passed over in favour of Adaeze’s unpolished uncle, Godswill. Determined to fight her way to the top, but not wanting to go against her father’s wishes, Adaeze felt like the proverbial bus had left the station without her. However, when she and Godswill discovered that Lionheart is running on fumes, the unlikely duo had to come together to save the company and their family name. Nnaji’s film highlight the everyday sexism that saturates workplaces and captures the delicate balance between honouring one’s family while finding the courage to strike out on one’s own.

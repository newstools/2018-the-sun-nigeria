Michael Schumacher will reportedly be moved to a luxury home once owned by Real Madrid president Florentino Perez. The seven-times Formula One champion suffered life-threatening injuries in a skiing accident in 2013. Schumacher currently lives in the Swiss town of Gland with his family but is expected to move to Mallorca shortly. The property is valued at €30million (£27m) and has a main residence of 3,000 square metres and includes two large gardens and two swimming pools.

The magazine continues: “The place, surrounded by solid walls, has many advantages: it is located on a promontory, a part of which becomes a small precipice, which makes the property inaccessible to prying eyes.” Official updates from Schumacher’s family have been incredibly scarce in the years following his accident. Fans continue to pay tribute to the racing legend Schumacher was holidaying with friends and family in the French Alps when he suffered a ‘severe head injury’ while skiing on December 29, 2013. He was airlifted to Grenoble Hospital requiring ‘immediate neurosurgical intervention’ and underwent two life-saving operations. Schumacher remained in a coma, with doctors describing his condition as ‘extremely serious’ the day after his admission. It is thought he would have died if he had not been wearing a ski helmet.

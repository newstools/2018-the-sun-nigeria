NAN Malaysia’s ex-premier Najib Razak had his application for a gag order on his corruption trial dismissed, a High Court judge ruled on Friday. Najib’s lawyers had requested the Kuala Lumpur court to implement a gag order, which would have put restrictions on how the media could cover his case. But judge Mohamad Ghazali said that existing laws sufficed. “Those, who overstep (in reporting) risk action being taken- such as contempt of court – and these remedies are readily available,” the judge was quoted as saying by The Star news portal. Najib’s lawyer Shafee Abdullah said the defence team would file an appeal on Aug. 13, The Star reported. Najib pleaded not guilty after he was slapped with money laundering charges, criminal breach of trust and abuse of power in the sprawling 1MDB corruption scandal case.

Mcilroy is regarded as Burnley’s finest player and was a central figure in the team, who won the English title in 1960. Signed by the Clarets from Glentoran in 1950, McIlroy scored 10 goals in 55 caps for Northern Ireland. The creative, attacking player was at the heart of a Burnley team, who did not finish outside the top seven in the top flight between 1956 and 1963.

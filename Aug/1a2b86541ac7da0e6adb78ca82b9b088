NAN Burnley  Manager Sean Dyche said Fulham had spent wisely in the transfer window after his side lost 4-2 at Craven Cottage in the Premier League on Sunday. Fulham became the first promoted club to spend over 100 million pounds ($127.53 million) in a close season as they look to solidify their return to the top flight after dropping down in 2014. Jean Michael Seri, who cost a reported 25 million pounds, opened the scoring before Jeff Hendrick equalised for Burnley. Aleksandar Mitrovic, a 22 million pounds arrival from Newcastle United, then scored twice to put the hosts up 3-1. Loan signing Andre Schurrle added Fulham’s fourth after James Tarkowski had given Burnley hope with a goal just before half-time.

Burnley, who brought in goalkeeper Joe Hart, defender Ben Gibson, winger Vinnie Steels and Czech striker Matej Vydra to the squad in the summer, have the added pressure of competing in the Europa League. Dyche’s teams have already played five qualifying games and have another on Thursday where they will look to overturn a 3-1 deficit at home to Olympiakos to make the group stage. “We know the challenges around us and we knew all about the noises outside the club about the Europa League and how that is going to challenge us. “It is difficult for the players; they have been bombarded with negatives about the challenge. But we have to see beyond that… because we are a good side, as we showed last season ,” Dyche added.

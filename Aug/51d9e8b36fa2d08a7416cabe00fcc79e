Tottenham Hotspur will play their first home Champions League match this season at Wembley Stadium as a result of the delay to their new stadium opening, the Premier League club said on Monday. Spurs were initially scheduled to play their first game at the new 62,000-capacity White Hart Lane venue on Sept. 15 against Liverpool. Spurs said they have agreed with UEFA to host their first home Champions League match – in either the week of Sept. 17 or Oct. 1 – at Wembley.

Spurs said they could reverse the fixture, or opt to host at a neutral venue, with Wembley unavailable in the week commencing Sept. 24.

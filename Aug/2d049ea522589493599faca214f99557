NAN Omatseye Nesiama, an International Association of Athletics Federation (IAAF) Licensed Manager, on Wednesday urged Africa’s representatives to the forthcoming IAAF World Cup to do the continent proud. The Confederation of African Athletics (CAA) had on Tuesday selected 77 athletes from across the continent to represent Africa at the competition scheduled for Sept. 8 to Sept. 9 in Ostrava, Czech Republic. Nesiama, who was reacting to the list, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that the athletes while competing for laurels, should also be entertaining in order to sell the sport.

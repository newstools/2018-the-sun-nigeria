Paul Osuyi, Asaba To enable public servants in Delta State participate in the on-going continuous voters’ registration (CVR) exercise, the state government has declared Thursday and Friday as work-free days. This is coming just as the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), on Tuesday, announced the extension of the exercise from August 17 by another two weeks. A statement signed by the Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Mr. Festus Ovie Agas, said all public officers, who have not registered before now, are expected to take advantage of the work-free days to do so and ensure they are not disenfranchised. Agas also urged public servants that are yet to collect their permanent voter’s cards (PVCs) to take advantage of the period to do so “and conclude this important aspect of the nation’s political process.” Meanwhile, Governor Ifeanyi Okowa, has advocated peaceful kingdoms, which he said will translate to peaceful local government areas and snowball into a peaceful nation.

Senate President Bukola Saraki has declared his intention to run for presidency in the 2019 general elections. Sen. Saraki made the declaration, on Thursday, while delivering a keynote address at a dialogue for youths and young aspirants in Abuja. He listed several challenges which he believes have clogged the wheels of progress in the nation. Saraki highlighted extreme poverty, hunger, lack of education and mass unemployment as some of the things that have paved way for more crime and insecurity in the nation, adding that it is now time for Nigerians to rebuild the nation with new leadership. Also, he stated that the economy is broken while the nation has now, more than ever, witnessed division along regional, religious and ethnic lines, a situation he believes should be addressed urgently in order for the nation to grow.

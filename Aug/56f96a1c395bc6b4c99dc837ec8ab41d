NAN Top seed Simona Halep sent Caroline Garcia packing for the second consecutive year at the Rogers Cup in Montreal on Friday with a 7-5 6-1 win to set up a semi-final showdown with Ashleigh Barty on Saturday. The French Open champion showed no signs of fatigue following her marathon three-set win over Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova on Wednesday, running down balls to extend points and wear down the slower Garcia. After a shaky start Halep won three straight games to take the first set and dominated the second set behind pinpoint serving and stout defense. Next up for Halep is Australian Barty, who strolled to a 6-3 6-1 win over Kiki Bertens in their quarter-final match earlier in the day.

Tennis A tireless Roger Federer wowed the crowds not once but twice at the Western & Southern Open on Friday, beating Leonardo Mayer in straight sets in a rain-delayed third-round match and then returning to center court at night to edge longtime rival Stan Wawrinka in a three-set quarterfinal thriller. Federer’s first match of the day started off routinely but got complicated towards the end. He needed just 23 minutes to take the first set from Mayer, 6-1, but neither player was able to break serve in the second set and it went down to a tiebreaker. Federer stormed ahead 5-1 in the breaker but ended up letting that lead go and eventually closed out a tight 6-1, 7-6 (6) victory with his 10th ace of the match.

Though Federer had four break points—including double set point with Wawrinka serving 5-6, 15-40—neither player was able to break serve in the first set and Wawrinka raced through the tiebreaker, 7-2. The second set followed the same pattern with Federer failing to convert the only break point of the set, and things looked dicey for the world No. 2 as he was two points away from going out at 6-all in the breaker. But he snuck out the last two points to send the match into a third set. It was in the sixth game of the deciding set where Federer broke through, finally converting on his eighth break point of the match to go up 4-2, and he actually ended up winning the last nine points of the match—holding at love for 5-2 and breaking at love in the next game—to clinch it, 6-7 (2), 7-6 (6), 6-2.

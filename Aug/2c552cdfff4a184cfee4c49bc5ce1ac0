Bindow insists He also urged Nigerians to further devote their prayers at the Eid praying grounds to the call on Allah to restore peace and strengthen our unity in all parts of the country, and rebuild the economy. Saraki, while congratulating the Muslim faithful, said it was a period that signified the willingness of Prophet Ibrahim to sacrifice his son to show submission to Allah’s command. “As we have read from the Glorious Qur’an, just when Ibrahim was about to kill his son, Ishmael, Almighty Allah (SWT) put a sheep in its place. “Muslims should use the Eid el-Kabir season to celebrate Prophet Ibrahim’s obedience to the will of Allah and as a reminder of our willingness to make sacrifices in obedience to Allah.”

Obinna Odogwu, Abakaliki Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State, on Wednesday, announced that the state government would start an airport project in the state early next year. He said that arrangement has been set in motion towards the actualisation of that project. Governor Umahi disclosed this while hosting some officials of the Ethiopian Airline led by its Traffic and Sales Manager (Enugu), Mr. Solomon Mengistu, who paid him a courtesy call in Government House, Abakaliki, the state capital. “We will start an airport project in Ebonyi early next year. The airport we will build may not be the biggest airport in the country but it will be the most beautiful. And there is nothing we say in this government that we cannot do”, he announced. Meanwhile, the governor complained bitterly about the “substandard” aircrafts some international airlines send to Nigeria whereas they fly the best in their home countries and other western countries. “I once complained to (name withheld) airline. I asked them why is it that they send substandard plane to Nigeria and when you get to Dubai, you now fly beautiful aircrafts even the one that you can take your bath inside if you’re in first class. “If I were the President of this country, I will not allow it. We need to be treated like other countries”, he said.

Dillian Whyte is “favourite” to face Anthony Joshua at Wembley in April, with Dereck Chisora on a three-man shortlist for the British heavyweight’s next fight in December. Joshua is currently preparing to defend his WBA ‘super’, IBF and WBO titles against Alexander Povetkin at the national stadium on September 22, live on Sky Sports Box Office, and Whyte could have earned his shot at the unified champion next year after a dramatic win over Joseph Parker in July.

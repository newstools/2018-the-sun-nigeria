Jo-Wilfried Tsonga has been forced to withdraw from the US Open after failing to recover sufficiently from knee surgery. The Frenchman had surgery on his troublesome knee back in April but is still unable to perform at the required intensity to compete at the final Slam of the year. The 33-year-old posted a video on Twitter in which he explained to fans that he would not be able to play at Flushing Meadows. READ ALSO Gov.

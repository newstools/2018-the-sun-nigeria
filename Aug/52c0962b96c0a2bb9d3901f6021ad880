NAN The National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON) says it has revived its Health Awareness Committee (HAC) to collaborate with Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Health in creating awareness among Nigerian pilgrims. Head, National Medical Team of NAHCON, Dr Ibrahim Kana, disclosed this to newsmen on a National Hajj Media Team platform, on Thursday. “The HAC worked creditably well last year. The Nigerian Health Ministry has an excellent relationship with its Saudi counterpart. “The committee is expected to develop awareness creation system directly to the pilgrims by visiting and interacting with them in their residences,’’ he said. Kana said that the committee would swing into action on Thursday at a meeting in Makkah.

NAN Zimbabwe’s opposition leader Nelson Chamisa on Friday filed a petition challenging the July 30 presidential election results at the Constitutional Court. “Our legal team successfully filed our court papers. We have a good case and cause,” the 40-year-old leader of opposition party Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) said on Twitter. The move comes after Chamisa narrowly lost the July 30 election to incumbent Emmerson Mnangagwa.

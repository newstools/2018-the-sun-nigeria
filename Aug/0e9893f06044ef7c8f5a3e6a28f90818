Al-Sarraj praised the “armed forces who, in spite of the division and lack of equipment, stand valiantly alongside the security forces against the terrorists, mercenaries, smugglers, and human traffickers, who are trying to tamper with the stability of the homeland.” “We stress again the necessity to unify the military establishment. A united army is the basis of a united homeland. “It expresses the national unity of our people of all walks of life and in all areas,” Al-Sarraj said.

SG have confirmed they’ve fielded takeover interest for Liverpool. It has emerged that Abu Dhabi-based Sheik Khaled Bin Zayed Al Nehayan, the cousin of Manchester City owner Sheik Mansour, tried to buy Liverpool earlier this year for a world record €2bn.

Proof of funds wasn’t forthcoming but FSG insist they did not agree to sell Liverpool for £2billion and that all dialogue with Sheik Khaled ended in January. A club statement read: “FSG have been clear and consistent: the club is not for sale. “But what the ownership has said, again clearly and consistently, is that under the right terms and conditions we would consider taking on a minority investor, if such a partnership was to further our commercial interests in specific market places and in line with the continued development and growth of the club and the team.”

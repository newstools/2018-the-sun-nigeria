The NYSC Zamfara State Coordinator, Mr Dahusi Muhammad made the clarification during the opening ceremony of the NYSC 2018 Batch ‘B’ Stream II, on Thursday in Katsina. ‘’For us NYSC, we have our policy and procedures of doing things; we are always on camp based on the number of prospective corps members produced by institutions. ‘’Now as we speak, the number of corps members from our institutions are very limited to the extent that they cannot go round all the states of the federation. ‘’Because of that, the NYSC management deemed it necessary to merge some camps to make the orientation management easier.

NAN Hundreds of Osun-bound passengers, who had gathered at the Iddo Terminal of the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) in Lagos for the free train ride of the Osun Government ahead of the Sallah, were stranded on  Sunday. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the huge number of passengers who turned out for the free ride were more than  the available coaches. Some of the stranded passengers, who spoke to a NAN correspondent, said they were pained at not making the trip. They, however, commended the governor’s gesture. Mr Jerry Oche, the Lagos State District Manager of  NRC,  said that the passengers available for the gesture were more than the available coaches.

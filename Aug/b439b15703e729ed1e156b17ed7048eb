The Education Ministry however, offereds gradual increases between 14 per cent for new teachers and six per cent for their experienced colleagues. During the rally, the striking teachers voiced readiness to go on a two-day strike if they did not receive a better offer from the ministry, the media outlet reported. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern addressed the crowd after the rally, calling on the teachers to cooperate with the government on the issue and noting that meaningful change would take time. New Zealand’s teachers walked off the job for the first time since 1994.

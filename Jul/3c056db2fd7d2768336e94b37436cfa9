Bellerin emerged as one of the most promising full-backs in Europe but struggled last season in what was Arsene Wenger’s final campaign in charge. He will hope to revive his career under new manager Unai Emery and says it is ‘crazy’ that there are question marks over his commitment to Arsenal. Barcelona have expressed interest in signing Bellerin, while Pep Guardiola is believed to have considered a move to bring the 23-year-old to Manchester City.

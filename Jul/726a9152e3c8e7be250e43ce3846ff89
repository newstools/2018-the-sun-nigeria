NAN A Yola High Court presided by Justice Hafsat Abdulrahman on Friday voided the appointment of the District Head of Jalingo-Maiha, Yarima Wakili, by the state government. The court ordered Governor Muhammadu Bindow to approve Mahmud Abubakar, whose name was earlier forwarded to him for approval by Mubi Emirate Council as the selected traditional ruler. Mahmud Abubakar (Plaintiff) had dragged the governor, Mubi Emirate Council, Yarima Wakili and Attorney-General of the state as 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th defendants, respectively, over the appointment of Wakili as the district head of Jalingo-Maiha in Maiha Local Government Area. In her Judgment, Justice Abdulrahman said the plaintiff has proven that he was eligible and was duly selected among other applicants for the district head stool by village heads in Maiha, who conducted the selection exercise under the supervision of representatives from Mubi Emirate Council.

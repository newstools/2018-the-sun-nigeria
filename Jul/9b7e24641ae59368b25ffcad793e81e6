Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has called on Christian clerics to speak out against the dictatorial tendencies of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Federal Government for the sustenance of the nationâ€™s democracy. The governor said keeping quiet at this critical point will not augur well for the growth of the country.
Speaking during the 10th memorial anniversary of the late Bishop Samuel Onyuku Elenwo at the state Ecumenical Centre, Wike urged clerics to pay more attention to the political developments in the country.

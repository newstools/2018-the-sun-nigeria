NAN The General Manager, Delta Tourism Board, Mrs Josephine Anyameluhor, says the hospitality industry has concluded plan to host the African Athletics Confederation (CAA) African Senior Athletics Championship holding in Asaba from Wednesday to Sunday. Anyameluhor told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Tuesday in Asaba that some of the hotels, eateries and lounges complied with the ongoing registration and classification of hotels ahead of the competition. “We cannot get 100 per cent compliance but as of today (Tuesday), some of the hotels, eateries, lounge among others have complied with the order. “And we know more of them will still comply because the exercise will be a continuous one and those who have not been able to do their registration now will surely do it later. “This is because any hotel, eatery and lounge which fails to register will be blacklisted and sanctioned by the state government,’’ she said. The general manager said the exercise was used as a yardstick to approve hotels and eateries for visitors during the competition. Anyameluhor said the ongoing registration was part of the efforts of the state government to re-position the hospitality industry.

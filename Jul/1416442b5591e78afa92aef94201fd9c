Mrs. Amosun made the statement during the flag off of the first round of 2018 MNCHW and second round of 2018 IPDs at the Osiele Primary Health Centre, Osiele in Odeda Local Government Area of the state.

In his remarks, Commissioner for Health, Dr. Babatunde Ipaye, noted that last year, there were series of epidemic outbreaks in the country, in which the state was not affected, as a result of the consistent rounds of the MNCHW and IPDs that have helped to boost the immunity of children in the state.

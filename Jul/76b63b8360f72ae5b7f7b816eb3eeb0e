Joseph Parker wants to send out a defiant message by stopping Dillian Whyte even quicker than Anthony Joshua. The 26-year-old’s unbeaten record and WBO belt were taken away by Joshua in a points defeat in March, but Parker has returned for Saturday’s heavyweight fight with Whyte. Whyte also suffered his sole defeat to Joshua, a seventh round knockout loss in 2015, and Parker intends to outshine the unified world champion by producing a more ruthless win over the Brixton fighter.

And what?’ “I think if I knock him out earlier, it will send a statement.” Promoter David Higgins says Parker can stake his claim for a Wembley rematch against Joshua, but the New Zealander insists victory would not lead to a heated confrontation, if Joshua is watching from ringside. “I think just let your performance speak itself,” said Parker. “There’s no point walking over and going, ‘Hey,’ you just look like a desperate guy. Just let it pan out.”

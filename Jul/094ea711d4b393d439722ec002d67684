Since they have left this morning, I felt I should inform you, Ekiti people , Nigerians and international community that l am still being locked at the government office. I urge you to help tell the Federal Government and security agents and others that I should be left alone, l and my family have a right to life.

I knew something is happening. I will convey your message to the chairman traditional council of Obas in Ekiti. We had discussed you this morning and wondered where you are. We use this opportunity too to appeal to the security operatives to, in the name of God restore your security to you. Whatever it is, we are in Ekiti and they should allow us to intervene in this matter, all the three of you in the race, yourself, Professor Olusola Elena, and Dr. Kayode Fayemi are our sons. You are all our eminent sons that cannot be wished away. We urge all parties to allow peace to reign. We will also get in touch with Dr. Fayemi to use his good office to intervene, ” the monarch assured.

The French manager was appointed Real boss in January 2016 and oversaw a period of European dominance at the Bernabeu. Zidane quit in May, citing fatigue, and was replaced by Julen Lopetegui. Zidane moving to Juventus is certain not a surprise, considering his history with the club. The former midfielder was Juve’s for five years before he was sold to Real for a then-record transfer fee of €77.5m in 2001. He left Juventus having won two Serie A titles but never clinched the Champions League with the Old Lady. He was signed after Juve beat Ajax on penalties in the 1996 final and was on the losing side in both 1997 and 1998 as the Turn club lost to Borussia Dortmund and Real Madrid respectively.

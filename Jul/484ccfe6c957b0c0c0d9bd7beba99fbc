Wole Balogun, Ado-Ekiti Twenty-three members of Ekiti State House of Assembly, on Friday, passed vote of confidence on Governor Ayodele Fayose and dissociated themselves from an alleged plot to impeach the governor. Armed policemen allegedly caused a stir when they laid siege on the Assembly premises, on Wednesday night, to pave way for the three lawmakers of the opposition All Progressives Congress (APC) to reconvene the plenary, a week after the members had gone on recess. The move was condemned by Speaker Kolawole Oluwawole at a press briefing, on Friday, when he alleged that the Assembly’s Clerk’s signature was forged in a letter purportedly written to request for police cover. But the chairman, House Committee on information, Samuel Omotoso, who spoke with newsmen on behalf of the 23 members at Government House, said they came on a solidarity visit to Governor Fayose. He also expressed displeasure at the siege on the Assembly by the security agents, saying that the members are solidly behind the Governor. Omotoso said the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) lawmakers were fully in support of the move by the party to retrieve Olusola’s mandate which was allegedly stolen from him.

He has been through different stages of leadership and this makes him stand out among many other aspirants who have indicated interest to become president. “Age is  on his side, and he has been able to unite the National Assembly and can be able to unite the country and move it forward. “Nigerians want a President who can move the country forward and bring unity and peace to the people, to salvage the nation  from our present Socio-economic and political quagmire,the reason we are calling on Bukola Saraki to declare for the 2019 Presidential election”.

We are mobilising and making contacts with Northern leaders, traditional and religious leaders, youths in the region and concerned politicians”

FOX Madrid signed the player two years ago for 45 million euros (A$71M), in a deal that would become official after his 18th birthday on July 12, 2018. Vinicius Junior was accompanied on his trip to Madrid by compatriot and former Real player Ronaldo, who led Brazil to the World Cup title in 2002. “Vinicius is a player with a lot of quality and talent. He’s the biggest prospect for the future of Brazilian football,” said Ronaldo. The player said he was ready to seize his chance. “This is the best opportunity a football player could have,” said the youngster who joined Flamengo at age 10. “I’m going to sacrifice a lot to show that I deserve this opportunity,” he said at his presentation alongside Madrid president Florentino Perez. “Even at this age (18) I’ll show the coach and my teammates that I’m ready to play, ready to do whatever is necessary”.

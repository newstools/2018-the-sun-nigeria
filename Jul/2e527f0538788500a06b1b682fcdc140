Those who know him should expect more than this. “On daily basis people are dying in the name of farmers/herdsmen crisis and nothing is done about it. They have conspired with security agencies to wipe away Nigerians. “All Nigerians should wake up and fight against these excesses. It is not the issue of APC or PDP. It is a national fight that all well meaning Nigerians should join. “Last two weeks, a sitting governor, with immunity was manhandled by security agencies. It is a height of insensitivity and political dictatorship and it portends danger on our nascent democracy”, he said.

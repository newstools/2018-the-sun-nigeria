KhaleejTimes An Afghan official says gunmen opened fire on worshippers inside a mosque in eastern Nangarhar province, killing four people. Attahullah Khogyani, the provincial governor’s spokesman, says three people, including the mosque’s religious leader, were wounded in the attack, which took place on Sunday evening in the district of Surkh Rod. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, but both the Taleban and Daesh militants are active in eastern Afghanistan, especially in Nangarhar province.

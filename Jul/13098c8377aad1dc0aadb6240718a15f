A young woman has been detained after the body of a newborn baby was found in the toilet of an aircraft in India. AirAsia crew found the baby on Wednesday, minutes before the plane touched down in New Delhi after a flight from Guwahati. “A doctor from the medical team at Delhi International Airport confirmed that the baby had been delivered on board,” an AirAsia statement said. The airline said all female passengers were questioned before the baby’s mother was identified.
